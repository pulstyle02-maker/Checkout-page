            <h2>CHAPTER 55: Spinal Cord Motor Functions; The Cord Reflexes</h2>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <span class="concept-title">1. Motor Control Hierarchy & Cord Function</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    Sensory information is integrated at all levels of the nervous system and causes appropriate motor responses that begin in the <strong>spinal cord</strong> with relatively simple muscle reflexes, extend into the <strong>brain stem</strong> with more complicated responses, and finally extend to the <strong>cerebrum</strong>, where the most complicated muscle skills are controlled. This chapter discusses spinal cord control of muscle function. Without the special neuronal circuits of the cord, even the most complex motor control systems in the brain could not cause any purposeful muscle movement. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> There is no neuronal circuit anywhere in the brain that causes the specific to-and-fro movements of the legs that are required in walking. Instead, the circuits for these movements are in the cord, and the brain simply sends "command" signals to the spinal cord to set into motion the walking process.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Role of the Brain:</strong> The brain gives directions that control the sequential cord activities—for example, to promote turning movements when they are required, to lean the body forward during acceleration, to change the movements from walking to jumping as needed, and to monitor continuously and control equilibrium. All this is done through "analytical" and "command" signals generated in the brain. However, the many neuronal circuits of the spinal cord that are the objects of the commands are also required. These circuits provide all but a small fraction of the direct control of the muscles.

                <span class="concept-title">2. Anterior Motor Neurons</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    Located in each segment of the <strong>anterior horns</strong> of the cord gray matter are several thousand neurons that are 50 to 100% larger than most of the others, called anterior motor neurons. They give rise to the nerve fibers that leave the cord by way of the <strong>anterior roots</strong> and directly innervate the skeletal muscle fibers. The neurons are of two types, alpha motor neurons and gamma motor neurons.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Alpha Motor Neurons:</strong> The alpha motor neurons give rise to large <strong>type A alpha (Aα)</strong> motor nerve fibers, averaging <strong>14 micrometers</strong> in diameter; these fibers branch many times after they enter the muscle and innervate the large skeletal muscle fibers. Stimulation of a single alpha nerve fiber excites from three to several hundred skeletal muscle fibers, which are collectively called the <strong>motor unit</strong>.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Gamma Motor Neurons:</strong> Along with the alpha motor neurons, about one-half as many much smaller gamma motor neurons are located in the spinal cord anterior horns. These transmit impulses through much smaller <strong>type A gamma (Aγ)</strong> motor nerve fibers, averaging <strong>5 micrometers</strong> in diameter, which go to small, special skeletal muscle fibers called <strong>intrafusal fibers</strong>. These fibers constitute the middle of the <strong>muscle spindle</strong>, which helps control basic muscle "tone".
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <span class="concept-title">3. Interneurons & Inhibitory Cells</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Interneurons:</strong> Interneurons are present in all areas of the cord gray matter—in the dorsal horns, the anterior horns, and the intermediate areas between them. These cells are about <strong>30 times as numerous</strong> as the anterior motor neurons. They are small and highly excitable, often exhibiting spontaneous activity and capable of firing as rapidly as <strong>1500 times per second</strong>. They have many interconnections with one another, and many also synapse directly with anterior motor neurons. The interconnections are responsible for most integrative functions of the spinal cord. Essentially all types of neuronal circuits (diverging, converging, repetitive-discharge) are found here. Only a few incoming sensory signals or brain signals terminate directly on anterior motor neurons; almost all are transmitted first through interneurons for processing.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Renshaw Cells & Lateral Inhibition:</strong> Located in the anterior horns in close association with motor neurons are a large number of small neurons called Renshaw cells. Almost immediately after the anterior motor neuron axon leaves the body of the neuron, collateral branches from the axon pass to adjacent Renshaw cells. These are <strong>inhibitory cells</strong> that transmit inhibitory signals to the surrounding motor neurons. Thus, stimulation of each motor neuron tends to inhibit adjacent motor neurons, an effect called <strong>lateral inhibition</strong>. The motor system uses this lateral inhibition to focus, or sharpen, its signals in the same way the sensory system uses it to allow unabated transmission of the primary signal in the desired direction while suppressing lateral spread.

                <span class="concept-title">4. Multisegmental Connections (Propriospinal Fibers)</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    More than half of all the nerve fibers that ascend and descend in the spinal cord are <strong>propriospinal fibers</strong>. These fibers run from one segment of the cord to another. As sensory fibers enter the cord from posterior roots, they bifurcate and branch both up and down the spinal cord; some branches transmit signals to only a segment or two, while others transmit to many segments. These fibers provide pathways for <strong>multisegmental reflexes</strong>, including reflexes that coordinate simultaneous movements in the forelimbs and hindlimbs.

                <span class="concept-title">5. Muscle Spindle: Structure & Innervation</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    Proper control of muscle function requires continuous feedback of muscle status. <strong>Muscle Spindles</strong> are distributed throughout the muscle belly to detect muscle length and rate of change of length. They operate at a subconscious level.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong> Each spindle is 3 to 10 millimeters long. It is built around 3 to 12 tiny <strong>intrafusal muscle fibers</strong> that are pointed at their ends and attached to the glycocalyx of the surrounding large <strong>extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers</strong>. Each intrafusal fiber is a tiny skeletal muscle fiber. However, the central region (midway between ends) has few or no actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, this central portion <strong>does not contract</strong> when the ends do. Instead, it functions as a sensory receptor. The end portions that do contract are excited by small <strong>gamma motor nerve fibers</strong> (gamma efferent fibers) originating from small type A gamma motor neurons in the anterior horns.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Sensory Excitation:</strong> Sensory fibers originate in the central receptor area and are stimulated by stretching of this midportion. The receptor can be excited in two ways: (1) <strong>Lengthening the whole muscle</strong> stretches the midportion and excites the receptor. (2) <strong>Contraction of the end portions</strong> of the intrafusal fibers stretches the midportion and excites the receptor even if the length of the entire muscle does not change.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <span class="concept-title">6. Spindle Sensory Endings & Responses</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Primary Ending (Annulospiral):</strong> In the center of the receptor area, a large sensory nerve fiber encircles the central portion of each intrafusal fiber. This is a <strong>type Ia fiber</strong> averaging 17 micrometers in diameter, transmitting signals at <strong>70 to 120 m/sec</strong> (as rapidly as any nerve fiber in the body).
                    <br>
                    <strong>Secondary Ending:</strong> Usually one or two smaller sensory nerve fibers (<strong>type II fibers</strong>, 8 micrometers diameter) innervate the receptor region on one or both sides of the primary ending, sometimes encircling the fibers or spreading like branches on a bush.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Static Response:</strong> When the receptor portion is stretched slowly, the number of impulses from both Primary and Secondary endings increases almost directly in proportion to the degree of stretching. The endings continue to transmit these impulses for several minutes. This is the static response. Both primary and secondary endings respond to the length of the receptor. This response originates mainly from <strong>Nuclear Chain Fibers</strong>.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Dynamic Response:</strong> When the length of the spindle receptor increases suddenly, the <strong>Primary ending</strong> (but not the secondary ending) is stimulated powerfully. This is the dynamic response, meaning the primary ending responds extremely actively to a rapid <strong>rate of change</strong> in spindle length. Even when length increases only a fraction of a micrometer for a fraction of a second, the primary receptor transmits tremendous numbers of excess impulses, but only while length is actually increasing. As soon as length stops increasing, the extra discharge returns to the static response level. Conversely, shortening the spindle causes exactly opposite sensory signals. This response originates mainly from <strong>Nuclear Bag Fibers</strong>.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <span class="concept-title">7. The Muscle Stretch Reflex</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    The simplest manifestation of muscle spindle function is the <strong>muscle stretch reflex</strong>. Whenever a muscle is stretched suddenly, excitation of the spindles causes reflex contraction of the large skeletal muscle fibers of the stretched muscle and of closely allied synergistic muscles.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Neuronal Circuitry:</strong> A type Ia proprioceptor nerve fiber originates in a muscle spindle and enters a dorsal root. A branch of this fiber goes directly to the anterior horn of the cord gray matter and synapses with anterior motor neurons that send motor nerve fibers back to the <strong>same muscle</strong> from which the spindle fiber originated. This <strong>monosynaptic pathway</strong> allows a reflex signal to return with the shortest possible time delay.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Dynamic Stretch Reflex:</strong> Elicited by potent dynamic signals from primary endings caused by rapid stretch or unstretch. Causes instantaneous strong reflex contraction (or decrease) to oppose sudden changes in length. Over within a fraction of a second.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Static Stretch Reflex:</strong> Elicited by continuous static signals from both primary and secondary endings. Causes the degree of muscle contraction to remain reasonably constant, except when the nervous system wills otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Damping Function:</strong> An especially important function is the ability to prevent oscillation or jerkiness of body movements (damping or smoothing function). Signals from the spinal cord are often transmitted in an unsmooth form. When the muscle spindle apparatus is not functioning, muscle contraction is jerky (signal averaging function).

            <div class="concept-card">
                <span class="concept-title">8. Voluntary Control: Coactivation & Gamma System</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Coactivation:</strong> 31% of all motor nerve fibers to the muscle are small type A gamma efferent fibers. Whenever signals are transmitted from the brain to alpha motor neurons, the gamma motor neurons are stimulated simultaneously (coactivation). This causes both extrafusal and intrafusal fibers to contract at the same time.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> (1) It keeps the length of the receptor portion of the spindle from changing during the course of the whole muscle contraction, keeping the spindle reflex from opposing the contraction. (2) It maintains the proper damping function of the muscle spindle regardless of any change in muscle length (prevents the spindle from becoming flail).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Brain Control:</strong> The gamma efferent system is excited specifically by signals from the <strong>bulboreticular facilitatory region</strong> of the brain stem and secondarily by impulses from the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. The bulboreticular area is concerned with antigravity contractions; antigravity muscles have a high density of spindles.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Stabilization of Body Position:</strong> The bulboreticular region transmits excitatory signals through gamma fibers to intrafusal fibers in both agonist and antagonist muscles across a joint. This increases the sensitivity of stretch reflexes on both sides, producing tight, tense muscles opposing each other. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized, and any force tending to move the joint is opposed by highly sensitized stretch reflexes on both sides. This aids in detailed voluntary movements.

                <span class="concept-title">9. Clinical Applications: Knee Jerk & Clonus</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Knee Jerk:</strong> The knee jerk and other muscle jerks are used to assess the sensitivity of stretch reflexes. Striking the patellar tendon instantaneously stretches the quadriceps and excites a dynamic stretch reflex that causes the lower leg to jerk forward. These reflexes assess the degree of facilitation of spinal cord centers. Large lesions in motor areas of the brain (stroke) often cause exaggerated muscle jerks.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Clonus:</strong> Oscillation of muscle jerks. Explained by ankle clonus: Standing on tiptoes drops body -> stretches gastrocnemius -> stretch reflex lifts body -> reflex dies out -> body falls -> stretches again -> cycle repeats. Clonus occurs only when stretch reflexes are highly sensitized by facilitatory impulses (e.g., decerebrate animal).

                <span class="concept-title">10. Golgi Tendon Reflex</span>
                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Golgi Tendon Organ:</strong> An encapsulated sensory receptor through which muscle tendon fibers pass. About 10 to 15 muscle fibers are connected to each organ. Stimulated when this bundle is "tensed" by contracting or stretching the muscle. Detects <strong>muscle tension</strong> (unlike spindle which detects length). Has both dynamic and static responses.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Transmission:</strong> Signals are transmitted through large, rapidly conducting <strong>type Ib nerve fibers</strong> (average 16 micrometers). These transmit to local areas of the cord and through long fiber pathways (spinocerebellar tracts) to the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. The local cord signal excites a single <strong>inhibitory interneuron</strong> that inhibits the anterior motor neuron. This directly inhibits the individual muscle without affecting adjacent muscles.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Functions:</strong> (1) <strong>Prevent Excessive Tension:</strong> When tension becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect leads to a sudden reaction causing instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle (<strong>lengthening reaction</strong>). This is a protective mechanism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the tendon. (2) <strong>Equalize Contractile Force:</strong> Fibers exerting excess tension are inhibited, whereas those with too little tension become more excited. This spreads the muscle load over all fibers.

                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Flexor (Withdrawal) Reflex:</strong> In spinal or decerebrate animals, almost any cutaneous sensory stimulus from a limb causes the flexor muscles of the limb to contract, withdrawing the limb. Elicited most powerfully by stimulation of <strong>pain endings</strong> (pinprick, heat, wound), so it is also called a <strong>nociceptive reflex</strong>. The pathway involves the interneuron pool (not direct to motor neurons). It utilizes diverging circuits, reciprocal inhibition circuits, and afterdischarge circuits.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Afterdischarge:</strong> The contraction lasts for 0.1 to 3 seconds after the stimulus is over, depending on intensity. This is caused by repetitive firing of interneurons and reverberating circuits. It holds the irritated part away from the stimulus.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Crossed Extensor Reflex:</strong> About 0.2 to 0.5 second after a flexor reflex is elicited in one limb, the opposite limb begins to extend. Extension of the opposite limb can push the entire body away from the object causing the pain. Signals cross to the opposite side of the cord to excite extensor muscles. The long latency (200-500 ms) indicates many interneurons are involved. It has a prolonged period of afterdischarge.

                <div class="detail-text">
                    <strong>Positive Supportive Reaction:</strong> Pressure on the footpad of a decerebrate animal causes the limb to extend against the pressure to support body weight. The <strong>Magnet Reaction</strong> determines the direction of extension based on locus of pressure.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Stepping:</strong> Rhythmical stepping of a single limb can occur even with sensory nerves cut due to mutually reciprocal inhibition circuits oscillating within the cord. <strong>Diagonal Stepping (Mark Time):</strong> Reflex involving all four limbs where stepping occurs diagonally between forelimbs and hindlimbs.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Spinal Shock:</strong> When the spinal cord is suddenly transected in the upper neck, essentially all cord functions immediately become depressed to the point of total silence due to loss of continual tonic excitation from higher centers.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Effects:</strong> (1) Arterial blood pressure falls instantly to ~40 mm Hg (sympathetic block) but returns in days. (2) Skeletal reflexes return in order: Stretch -> Flexor -> Postural -> Stepping. (3) Sacral reflexes for bladder evacuation are suppressed but eventually return.

                    <strong>Primary Motor Cortex (Area 4):</strong> Topographical representation (Homunculus): Face/mouth near sylvian fissure (lateral); Arm/hand in midportion; Trunk near apex; Legs/feet in longitudinal fissure. More than half the area controls muscles of the <strong>hands</strong> and <strong>speech</strong>. Excitation of a single neuron excites a specific <strong>movement</strong> (pattern of separate muscles), not just a single muscle.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Premotor Area:</strong> Located 1-3 cm anterior to primary motor cortex. Generates complex patterns of movement (e.g., positioning shoulders/arms). Anterior part develops a "motor image"; posterior part excites muscle patterns. Contains <strong>Mirror Neurons</strong> that become active when performing a specific task or observing the same task performed by others (learning by imitation).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Supplementary Motor Area:</strong> Located in the longitudinal fissure and superior frontal cortex. Contractions are often <strong>bilateral</strong> (e.g., grasping with both hands). Functions with the premotor area to provide body-wide attitudinal movements and fixation movements.

                    <strong>Voluntary Eye Field:</strong> Controls eye movement/blinking; damage causes eyes to lock on objects.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Hand Skills Area:</strong> Damage causes <strong>motor apraxia</strong> (uncoordinated hand movements).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Corticospinal (Pyramidal) Tract:</strong> The most important output pathway for discrete, detailed movements. Originates: 30% Primary Motor, 30% Premotor, 40% Somatosensory. Pathway: Internal capsule -> Brain stem pyramids -> Cross to opposite side -> <strong>Lateral Corticospinal Tracts</strong>.

                    <strong>Betz Cells:</strong> Giant pyramidal cells (16 micrometers) found ONLY in the primary motor cortex. They transmit signals at <strong>70 m/sec</strong> (fastest from brain to cord). There are about 34,000 Betz fibers (3% of total); the other 97% are small background fibers.

                <div class="detail-text">
                    Located in the mesencephalon, the Red Nucleus receives fibers from the motor cortex (<strong>Corticorubral tract</strong>) and branching corticospinal fibers. These synapse in the lower <strong>magnocellular portion</strong> (containing large neurons similar to Betz cells), which gives rise to the <strong>Rubrospinal Tract</strong>. This tract crosses to the opposite side and descends in the lateral columns immediately adjacent to the corticospinal tract. This system serves as an accessory pathway for discrete signals; if corticospinal fibers are destroyed but this pathway is intact, wrist movements are functional, but fine control of fingers/hands is impaired.

                    Neurons in the motor cortex are organized in <strong>vertical columns</strong> (fraction of a millimeter diameter, thousands of neurons). Each column functions as an integrative processing unit and amplifying system.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Dynamic vs. Static Neurons:</strong> Dynamic neurons are excited at a high rate for a short period to cause initial rapid force development (greater percentage in Red Nucleus). Static neurons fire at a slower, continuous rate to maintain force (greater percentage in Primary Motor Cortex).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Lesions:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Removal of Primary Motor Cortex:</strong> Causes hypotonia and loss of voluntary control of discrete distal movements (hands/fingers), though gross postural movements remain.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Muscle Spasticity:</strong> Lesions involving adjacent areas (basal ganglia) remove the normal inhibition of vestibular and reticular nuclei. These nuclei become spontaneously active ("disinhibited"), causing excessive spastic tone.

                    <strong>Pontine Reticular Nuclei:</strong> Located posteriorly/laterally in the pons; transmit <strong>excitatory signals</strong> via the <strong>Pontine Reticulospinal Tract</strong> (anterior column) to excite axial antigravity muscles (vertebral column/limb extensors). They have high natural excitability.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Medullary Reticular Nuclei:</strong> Located ventrally/medially in the medulla; transmit <strong>inhibitory signals</strong> via the <strong>Medullary Reticulospinal Tract</strong> (lateral column) to the same antigravity neurons to counterbalance the pontine system. They are controlled by input from corticospinal/rubrospinal tracts.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Vestibular Nuclei:</strong> Function in association with pontine reticular nuclei to excite antigravity muscles via <strong>Vestibulospinal Tracts</strong>. Their specific role is to selectively control excitatory signals to maintain equilibrium.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Decerebrate Rigidity:</strong> When the brain stem is sectioned below the midlevel of the mesencephalon, the strong input to the medullary reticular inhibitory system is blocked. The medullary system becomes nonfunctional, leaving the pontine excitatory system unopposed and overactive, causing spastic rigidity in antigravity muscles.

                    <strong>Maculae (Utricle & Saccule):</strong> Sensory areas covered by gelatinous layer containing <strong>Statoconia</strong>. Detect <strong>Static Equilibrium</strong> (orientation to gravity) and <strong>Linear Acceleration</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Mechanism:</strong> Bending stereocilia <em>toward</em> the kinocilium opens cation channels causing <strong>depolarization</strong>. Bending <em>away</em> closes channels causing <strong>hyperpolarization</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Utricle:</strong> Horizontal plane (head upright). <strong>Saccule:</strong> Vertical plane (lying down).

                    <strong>Semicircular Ducts:</strong> Three ducts at right angles. Each has an ampulla containing a <strong>Crista Ampullaris</strong> and a <strong>Cupula</strong>. Detect <strong>Head Rotation (Angular Acceleration)</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Mechanism:</strong> When the head rotates, endolymph inertia causes fluid to remain stationary while ducts turn, causing relative fluid flow. This bends the cupula and stimulates hair cells.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Predictive Function:</strong> The ducts detect that the head is <em>beginning</em> to turn and predict that disequilibrium will occur <em>before</em> it happens, causing the equilibrium centers to make anticipatory adjustments (requires Flocculonodular lobes of cerebellum).

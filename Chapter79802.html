<h1>Chapter 79: Insulin, Glucagon, and Diabetes Mellitus</h1>

<h3>Physiological Anatomy of the Pancreas</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Tissue Types:</span> The pancreas is composed of two major types of tissues: (1) the <b>acini</b>, which secrete digestive juices into the duodenum, and (2) the <b>islets of Langerhans</b>, which secrete insulin and glucagon directly into the blood.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Islets of Langerhans:</span> The human pancreas has 1 to 2 million islets of Langerhans. Each islet is only about 0.3 millimeter in diameter and is organized around small capillaries, into which its cells secrete their hormones.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Cell Types:</span> • <b>Beta cells:</b> Constituting about 60% of all the cells of the islets, they lie mainly in the middle of each islet and secrete <b>insulin</b> and <b>amylin</b> (a hormone often secreted in parallel with insulin, function not well understood). • <b>Alpha cells:</b> Constituting about 25% of the total, they secrete <b>glucagon</b>. • <b>Delta cells:</b> Constituting about 10% of the total, they secrete <b>somatostatin</b>. • <b>PP cells:</b> Present in small numbers, they secrete a hormone called <b>pancreatic polypeptide</b>.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Communication:</span> The close interrelations among these cell types allow cell-to-cell communication and direct control of secretion. <b>Insulin</b> inhibits glucagon secretion; <b>Amylin</b> inhibits insulin secretion; <b>Somatostatin</b> inhibits the secretion of both insulin and glucagon.</p>

<h3>Insulin Chemistry and Synthesis</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Chemistry:</span> Human insulin is a small protein with a molecular weight of 5808. It is composed of two amino acid chains connected to each other by disulfide linkages. When the two amino acid chains are split apart, the functional activity of the insulin molecule is lost.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Synthesis Flowchart:</span> Synthesized in beta cells by the usual cell machinery for protein synthesis. &rarr; Translation of insulin RNA by ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms <b>preproinsulin</b> (molecular weight ~11,500). &rarr; Preproinsulin is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum to form <b>proinsulin</b> (molecular weight ~9,000), consisting of three chains of peptides: A, B, and C. &rarr; Most proinsulin is further cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to form <b>insulin</b> (composed of A and B chains connected by disulfide linkages) and the C chain peptide, called <b>connecting peptide (C peptide)</b>. &rarr; Insulin and C peptide are packaged in secretory granules and secreted in equimolar amounts. About 5-10% of the final secreted product is still in the form of proinsulin.</p>
<p><span class="topic">C Peptide Significance:</span> Although proinsulin and C peptide have virtually no insulin activity, C peptide binds to a G protein-coupled membrane receptor and elicits activation of at least two enzyme systems: sodium-potassium ATPase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. <b>C peptide levels can be measured by radioimmunoassay</b> to determine how much natural insulin is being produced. This is crucial for distinguishing endogenous insulin production from exogenous administration in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Transport & Metabolism:</span> Insulin circulates almost entirely in an unbound form. It has a plasma half-life that averages only about <b>6 minutes</b>, so it is mainly cleared from the circulation within 10 to 15 minutes. Except for the portion that combines with receptors in target cells, insulin is degraded by the enzyme <b>insulinase</b> mainly in the liver, to a lesser extent in the kidneys and muscles, and slightly in other tissues.</p>

<h3>Insulin Receptor and Cellular Effects</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Receptor Structure:</span> The insulin receptor is a membrane protein with a molecular weight of about 300,000. It is a tetramer composed of four subunits held together by disulfide linkages: <b>two alpha subunits</b> that lie entirely outside the cell membrane and <b>two beta subunits</b> that penetrate through the membrane, protruding into the cell cytoplasm.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Activation Mechanism:</span> Insulin binds with the alpha subunits on the outside of the cell. &rarr; Because of the linkages with the beta subunits, the portions of the beta subunits protruding into the cell become <b>autophosphorylated</b>. &rarr; This autophosphorylation activates a local <b>tyrosine kinase</b>, which in turn causes phosphorylation of multiple other intracellular enzymes, including a group called <b>insulin-receptor substrates (IRS)</b> (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3). &rarr; The net effect is to activate some enzymes while inactivating others, directing intracellular metabolic machinery.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Cellular Effects:</span> <b>1. Immediate (Seconds):</b> About 80% of the body's cells (especially muscle and adipose) markedly increase their uptake of glucose. This results from the translocation of multiple intracellular vesicles containing <b>GLUT 4</b> glucose transport proteins to the cell membrane. These vesicles separate from the membrane within 3-5 minutes when insulin is no longer available. <b>2. Permeability Changes:</b> The cell membrane becomes more permeable to many amino acids, potassium ions, and phosphate ions, causing increased transport into the cell. <b>3. Slower Effects (10-15 mins):</b> Activity levels of many intracellular metabolic enzymes change due to phosphorylation states. <b>4. Delayed Effects (Hours/Days):</b> Changed rates of translation of messenger RNAs at the ribosomes to form new proteins and changed rates of transcription of DNA in the cell nucleus.</p>

<h3>Effect of Insulin on Carbohydrate Metabolism</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Muscle:</span> <b>Resting Muscle:</b> The membrane is slightly permeable to glucose, so it depends on fatty acids for energy. However, during <b>moderate or heavy exercise</b>, muscle contraction increases translocation of GLUT 4 without insulin. Also, in the few hours <b>after a meal</b>, high insulin causes rapid transport of glucose into muscle cells. If glucose is not used immediately, it is stored as <b>glycogen</b> (up to 2-3% concentration). Insulin increases glucose transport into resting muscle cells at least 15-fold.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Liver:</span> One of the most important effects is to cause most of the glucose absorbed after a meal to be rapidly stored in the liver as glycogen. Mechanism: • <b>Inactivates liver phosphorylase:</b> Prevents the splitting of glycogen into glucose. • <b>Increases glucokinase activity:</b> Phosphorylates glucose to trap it inside the liver cell. • <b>Increases glycogen synthase activity:</b> Promotes polymerization of monosaccharide units to form glycogen. <b>Result:</b> Glycogen can increase to 5-6% of liver mass (100g). When blood glucose falls between meals, insulin decreases, phosphorylase is activated, and <b>glucose phosphatase</b> (inhibited by insulin) becomes active, splitting phosphate from glucose to release free glucose into the blood. <b>Excess Glucose:</b> When the liver can hold no more glycogen, insulin promotes conversion of excess glucose into <b>fatty acids</b>. These are packaged as triglycerides in VLDLs and transported to adipose tissue. Insulin also <b>inhibits gluconeogenesis</b> by decreasing liver enzymes and amino acid release from muscle.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Brain:</span> Brain cells are quite different; they are permeable to glucose <b>without the intermediation of insulin</b>. Brain cells normally use only glucose for energy and can use other substrates like fats only with difficulty. Therefore, it is essential that blood glucose be maintained above a critical level. When blood glucose falls too low (20 to 50 mg/100 ml), symptoms of hypoglycemic shock develop (progressive nervous irritability, fainting, seizures, coma).</p>

<h3>Effect of Insulin on Fat Metabolism</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Fat Synthesis & Storage:</span> <b>In Liver:</b> Insulin promotes fatty acid synthesis when glycogen capacity is reached. Glucose is split to pyruvate &rarr; Acetyl-CoA. Excess citrate and isocitrate ions activate <b>acetyl-CoA carboxylase</b> to form malonyl-CoA (first stage of fatty acid synthesis). Fatty acids are used to form triglycerides, released as VLDLs. <b>In Adipose Tissue:</b> • Insulin activates <b>lipoprotein lipase</b> in capillary walls, which splits triglycerides into fatty acids for absorption into fat cells (where they convert back to triglycerides). • Insulin inhibits the action of <b>hormone-sensitive lipase</b>, preventing hydrolysis of stored triglycerides and release of fatty acids. • Insulin promotes glucose transport into fat cells to form <b>alpha-glycerol phosphate</b>, which supplies the glycerol needed for triglyceride synthesis.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Insulin Deficiency:</span> <b>Lipolysis:</b> In the absence of insulin, all effects promoting fat storage are reversed. Hormone-sensitive lipase becomes strongly activated. This causes massive hydrolysis of stored triglycerides, releasing large quantities of fatty acids and glycerol into the circulating blood. Plasma free fatty acid concentration rises rapidly. <b>Cholesterol:</b> The excess of fatty acids in the plasma promotes liver conversion into phospholipids and cholesterol. Along with excess triglycerides, these are discharged into the blood in lipoproteins. High lipid concentration (3x normal) promotes rapid development of <b>atherosclerosis</b>.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Ketosis Mechanism:</span> Absence of insulin causes excessive fatty acid release from adipose tissue. &rarr; Excess fatty acids enter liver cells; carnitine transport mechanism transports them into mitochondria. &rarr; Beta-oxidation proceeds rapidly, releasing extreme amounts of Acetyl-CoA. &rarr; Excess Acetyl-CoA is condensed to form <b>acetoacetic acid</b>, which is released into the blood. &rarr; Some acetoacetic acid converts to <b>beta-hydroxybutyric acid</b> and <b>acetone</b>. These are called ketone bodies. &rarr; Accumulation leads to severe acidosis and diabetic coma.</p>

<h3>Effect of Insulin on Protein Metabolism and Growth</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Protein Anabolism:</span> Insulin promotes protein formation and prevents degradation: • Stimulates transport of many amino acids into cells (valine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine). • Increases translation of messenger RNA ("turns on" ribosomal machinery) to form new proteins. • Increases rate of transcription of selected DNA genetic sequences. • Inhibits catabolism of proteins (diminishes lysosomal degradation). • Depresses the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver (conserving amino acids).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Insulin Deficiency:</span> Protein storage halts. Catabolism increases. Large quantities of amino acids are dumped into the plasma and used for energy or gluconeogenesis. This degradation leads to enhanced urea excretion in the urine. The resulting protein wasting causes extreme weakness and deranged organ functions.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Growth Synergy:</span> Insulin and growth hormone interact <b>synergistically</b> to promote growth. An animal lacking either hormone will not grow; both are required. Each hormone promotes cellular uptake of a different selection of amino acids, all of which are required for growth.</p>

<h3>Mechanisms of Insulin Secretion</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Cellular Mechanism Flowchart:</span> Glucose enters beta cells via <b>GLUT 2</b> transporters (proportional to blood conc). &rarr; Inside the cell, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by <b>glucokinase</b>. This is the rate-limiting step and the major mechanism for glucose sensing. &rarr; Glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to form ATP. &rarr; ATP inhibits <b>ATP-sensitive potassium channels</b>. &rarr; Closure of these channels depolarizes the cell membrane. &rarr; Depolarization opens <b>voltage-gated calcium channels</b>. &rarr; Calcium influx triggers fusion of docked insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane and secretion of insulin into the ECF by exocytosis.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Regulation of Secretion:</span> <b>Increased Blood Glucose:</b> The primary controller. At fasting (80-90 mg/dl), secretion is minimal. If blood glucose rises 2-3x normal, secretion increases in two stages: (1) 10-fold increase within 3-5 minutes (dumping preformed insulin) then decreases; (2) rises to a second plateau at 15 minutes (new synthesis/release) and continues to rise. <b>Amino Acids:</b> Some amino acids (especially arginine and lysine) stimulate insulin secretion. They differ from glucose in that they potentiate the glucose stimulus (doubling secretion in the presence of elevated glucose) but cause only a small increase alone. <b>Gastrointestinal Hormones:</b> Gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and especially <b>glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)</b> and <b>glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP)</b> cause a moderate increase. These are called <b>incretins</b>; they cause an "anticipatory" increase in insulin before nutrients are absorbed. <b>Other Hormones:</b> Glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, progesterone, and estrogen stimulate insulin secretion. Prolonged excess of these hormones can lead to exhaustion of beta cells and diabetes. <b>Autonomic Nervous System:</b> Parasympathetic stimulation increases insulin secretion; sympathetic stimulation (norepinephrine) inhibits insulin.</p>

<h3>Glucagon and Its Functions</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Overview:</span> Glucagon, secreted by the alpha cells, increases blood glucose concentration. It is called the <b>hyperglycemic hormone</b>. It is a large polypeptide (MW 3485). 1 μg/kg can elevate blood glucose 20 mg/100 ml in 20 minutes.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Glycogenolysis:</span> Most dramatic effect. Mechanism: Glucagon activates <b>adenylyl cyclase</b> in the hepatic cell membrane. &rarr; Formation of cyclic AMP. &rarr; Activates protein kinase regulator protein &rarr; Activates protein kinase. &rarr; Activates phosphorylase b kinase. &rarr; Converts phosphorylase b into <b>phosphorylase a</b>. &rarr; Promotes degradation of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate &rarr; dephosphorylated &rarr; glucose released. This is a potent <b>amplifying mechanism</b> (cascade) where a few micrograms of glucagon can cause blood glucose to double.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Gluconeogenesis:</span> Even after all liver glycogen is exhausted, glucagon causes continued hyperglycemia by increasing the rate of amino acid uptake by liver cells and the conversion of amino acids to glucose (gluconeogenesis). This is achieved by activating multiple enzymes, especially for converting pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Other Effects:</span> Occur only at high concentrations well above maximum normal. Activates adipose cell lipase (making fatty acids available). Inhibits storage of triglycerides in liver. Enhances heart strength, increases blood flow to kidneys, enhances bile secretion, inhibits gastric acid secretion.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Regulation:</span> <b>1. Increased blood glucose</b> inhibits glucagon secretion. This is the most potent factor. <b>2. Decreased blood glucose</b> (hypoglycemia) stimulates glucagon secretion several-fold. It serves the function of correcting hypoglycemia. <b>3. Increased blood amino acids</b> (especially alanine and arginine) stimulate secretion of glucagon (same effect as insulin). The importance is that glucagon promotes rapid conversion of the amino acids to glucose. <b>4. Exercise</b> stimulates glucagon secretion 4 to 5-fold.</p>

<h3>Somatostatin</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Secretion:</span> Secreted by delta cells (14-amino acid polypeptide, extremely short half-life of 3 mins). Stimulated by factors related to food ingestion: (1) increased blood glucose, (2) increased amino acids, (3) increased fatty acids, (4) increased GI hormones.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Inhibitory Effects:</span> (1) Acts locally within islets to depress secretion of <b>both</b> insulin and glucagon. (2) Decreases motility of stomach, duodenum, and gallbladder. (3) Decreases both secretion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Role:</span> The principal role is to extend the period over which food nutrients are assimilated into the blood. It also decreases utilization of absorbed nutrients by tissues, preventing rapid exhaustion of food.</p>

<h3>Diabetes Mellitus</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Type 1 Diabetes (Insulin-Dependent):</span> <b>Cause:</b> Lack of insulin secretion. Injury to beta cells or diseases (viral infections or autoimmune disorders) impair insulin production. Heredity plays a major role. Usual onset at about 14 years (juvenile diabetes). <b>Pathophysiology:</b> Blood glucose rises to 300-1200 mg/100 ml. Increased glucose filters into renal tubules; when the threshold (~180 mg/dl) is exceeded, glucose spills into urine (glycosuria). Loss of glucose causes osmotic diuresis (massive fluid loss). This causes intracellular and extracellular dehydration and excessive thirst (polydipsia). Chronic high glucose causes tissue injury (heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, retinopathy, neuropathy). <b>Metabolic Acidosis:</b> The shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism increases release of keto acids (acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid). Severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) leads to diabetic coma and death. Compensations include rapid deep breathing (Kussmaul breathing) to blow off CO2 (acetone breath) and high acid excretion by kidneys. <b>Protein Depletion:</b> Causes rapid weight loss and asthenia (lack of energy) despite eating large amounts (polyphagia). <b>Treatment:</b> Administration of insulin (regular or long-acting).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Type 2 Diabetes (Non-Insulin-Dependent):</span> <b>Cause:</b> Caused initially by <b>insulin resistance</b> (decreased sensitivity of target tissues) followed by compensatory hyperinsulinemia and eventual beta cell exhaustion. Accounts for 90-95% of cases. Onset usually after age 30 (adult-onset). <b>Metabolic Syndrome:</b> Insulin resistance is part of a cascade called metabolic syndrome: (1) Obesity (especially abdominal/visceral fat). (2) Insulin resistance. (3) Fasting hyperglycemia. (4) Lipid abnormalities (high triglycerides, low HDL). (5) Hypertension. <b>Causes of Resistance:</b> Obesity, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Excess Glucocorticoids (Cushing's), Excess Growth Hormone (Acromegaly), Pregnancy. <b>Treatment:</b> Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight loss). Drugs: Thiazolidinediones (increase sensitivity), Metformin (suppresses liver glucose), Sulfonylureas (stimulate release), Incretin drugs (mimic GLP-1), SGLT2 inhibitors (prevent renal glucose reabsorption). Insulin may be required later.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Diagnosis:</span> <b>Urinary Glucose:</b> Simple office tests. <b>Fasting Blood Glucose:</b> Normal is 80-90 mg/100 ml; >115 indicates diabetes. <b>Glucose Tolerance Test:</b> Normal person ingests 1g glucose/kg; level rises to 120-140 mg/dl and returns to normal in 2 hours. Diabetic person rises much higher and fails to fall below control level after 4-6 hours. Type 1 has low plasma insulin; Type 2 has high plasma insulin initially. <b>Acetone Breath:</b> Small quantities of acetoacetic acid convert to acetone (volatile). <b>HbA1c:</b> Reflects average blood glucose over previous 3 months.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Insulinoma:</span> Adenoma of an islet of Langerhans produces excessive insulin. Causes <b>insulin shock</b> (hypoglycemia). As glucose falls to 50-70 mg/dl, the CNS becomes excitable (hallucinations, nervousness). At 20-50 mg/dl, clonic seizures and loss of consciousness occur. Below 20 mg/dl, coma occurs. Distinguished from diabetic coma by the absence of acetone breath/rapid breathing. Treatment: IV glucose and glucagon.</p>

<h1>Chapter 80: Parathyroid Hormone, Calcitonin, Calcium/Phosphate, Vitamin D, Bone, Teeth</h1>

<h3>Calcium and Phosphate Regulation Overview</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Calcium Control:</span> Extracellular fluid calcium concentration is regulated precisely at about <b>9.4 mg/dl</b> (2.4 mmol/L). It seldom rises or falls more than a few percent. This precise control is essential because calcium plays a key role in physiological processes like skeletal/cardiac/smooth muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve impulse transmission.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Excitable Cells:</span> <b>Hypocalcemia:</b> Causes the nervous system to become progressively more excitable due to increased neuronal membrane permeability to sodium ions. At 50% below normal, peripheral nerve fibers discharge spontaneously, causing tetanic muscle contraction. <b>Hypercalcemia:</b> Depresses the nervous system and muscle activity.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Distribution:</span> About 0.1% of total body calcium is in the extracellular fluid, 1% is in the cells/organelles, and the rest is stored in bones (large reservoir). Phosphate distribution: 85% in bones, 14-15% in cells, <1% in extracellular fluid.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Plasma Forms:</span> <b>Calcium:</b> (1) 41% combined with plasma proteins (non-diffusible). (2) 9% combined with anionic substances like citrate/phosphate (diffusible but non-ionized). (3) The remaining 50% is diffusible and <b>ionized</b> (1.2 mmol/L). This ionic calcium is the form important for most functions. <b>Phosphate:</b> Mainly in two forms: HPO4= and H2PO4-. The average total quantity is about 4 mg/dl. Changes in pH alter the relative quantity (acidic increases H2PO4-; alkaline increases HPO4=).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Nonbone Physiological Effects:</span> <b>Hypocalcemia:</b> Causes nervous system excitement and <b>tetany</b>. Carpopedal spasm (tetany in the hand) usually occurs first. Tetany occurs at ~6 mg/dl; lethal at ~4 mg/dl due to respiratory spasm. Can also cause seizures, dilated heart, impaired blood clotting. <b>Hypercalcemia:</b> Depresses nervous system. Reflexes become sluggish. Decreases QT interval of the heart. Causes lack of appetite/constipation (depressed GI contractility). Depressive effects begin at >12 mg/dl. Crystals of calcium phosphate precipitate throughout the body if calcium rises above 17 mg/dl (Parathyroid Poisoning).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Absorption & Excretion:</span> Daily intake ~1000 mg. Calcium is poorly absorbed from intestines; Vitamin D promotes absorption. About 35% (350 mg) is absorbed; remaining (plus secreted calcium) excreted in feces (900 mg/day). Approx 10% (100 mg/day) excreted in urine. Renal tubules reabsorb 99% of filtered calcium; PTH controls distal reabsorption. Phosphate is absorbed easily; renal excretion controlled by overflow mechanism (critical value ~1 mmol/L).</p>

<h3>Bone Physiology</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Bone Tissue:</span> Two types: <b>Cortical (compact) bone</b> (hard outer layer, 80% of mass) and <b>Trabecular (spongy) bone</b> (interior, 20% of mass, high turnover rate, contains marrow).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Composition:</span> Bone is composed of a tough <b>organic matrix</b> (30%) and <b>calcium salts</b> (70%). The organic matrix is 90-95% collagen fibers (tensile strength) and the rest is ground substance (proteoglycans like chondroitin sulfate/hyaluronic acid).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Bone Salts:</span> The principal crystalline salt is <b>hydroxyapatite</b>: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. Crystals are shaped like long flat plates. Magnesium, sodium, potassium, and carbonate are conjugated to the hydroxyapatite crystals. Bone can also deposit radioactive substances (strontium, uranium, plutonium, lead), which can cause prolonged irradiation and osteogenic sarcoma.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Mechanism of Calcification:</span> The initial stage is secretion of collagen molecules and ground substance by <b>osteoblasts</b>. Collagen polymerizes to form osteoid (cartilage-like material). Calcium salts begin to precipitate on the surfaces of collagen fibers. The initial salts are amorphous compounds, which are converted into hydroxyapatite crystals over weeks or months. Although ECF calcium/phosphate are supersaturated, inhibitors (like <b>pyrophosphate</b>) prevent precipitation in normal tissues. Osteoblasts secrete <b>Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP)</b> which neutralizes pyrophosphate to allow calcification. Deficiencies of NPP1 or ANK (which regulate pyrophosphate) can cause excessive calcification (bone spurs/ankylosis).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Calcium Exchange:</span> Bone contains a type of exchangeable calcium (0.4% to 1% of total bone calcium) in the form of amorphous salts (e.g., CaHPO4) which are in reversible equilibrium with the calcium and phosphate ions in the ECF. This provides a rapid buffering mechanism (30-60 minutes) to keep calcium ion concentration from rising to excessive levels or falling to low levels.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Bone Remodeling:</span> Bone is continually being deposited by <b>osteoblasts</b> and resorbed by <b>osteoclasts</b>. Osteoclasts are large, phagocytic, multinucleated cells. They send out villus-like projections forming a ruffled border adjacent to bone. Villi secrete: (1) <b>Proteolytic enzymes</b> (digest organic matrix). (2) <b>Acids</b> (citric/lactic acid, dissolve bone salts).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Control of Remodeling (RANKL/OPG):</span> PTH stimulates osteoclast activity and bone resorption indirectly. PTH binds to receptors on osteoblasts, stimulating synthesis of <b>RANKL</b> (receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. RANKL binds to its receptors (RANK) on preosteoclast cells, causing them to differentiate into mature osteoclasts. Osteoblasts also produce <b>Osteoprotegerin (OPG)</b>, a cytokine that inhibits bone resorption by acting as a "decoy" receptor for RANKL. Vitamin D and PTH stimulate production of mature osteoclasts by inhibiting OPG and stimulating RANKL. Estrogen stimulates OPG production (preventing bone resorption).</p>

<h3>Vitamin D</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Activation Flowchart:</span> <b>Skin:</b> Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) is formed from 7-dehydrocholesterol by irradiation with ultraviolet rays from the sun. &rarr; <b>Liver:</b> Cholecalciferol is converted to <b>25-hydroxycholecalciferol</b>. This process is feedback inhibited (important to regulate concentration and conserve stored Vitamin D). &rarr; <b>Kidney:</b> 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to <b>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol</b> in the proximal tubules. <span class="highlight">This step requires Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).</span> In the absence of PTH, almost none is formed. High plasma calcium concentration suppresses PTH, preventing conversion to the active form.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Actions:</span> The active form (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) functions as a hormone. It promotes <b>intestinal absorption of calcium</b> by increasing formation of <b>calbindin</b> (calcium-binding protein) in intestinal epithelial cells. It also promotes phosphate absorption. It decreases renal calcium and phosphate excretion (weak effect). Effect on bone depends on quantity: extreme quantities cause bone resorption; small quantities promote bone calcification.</p>

<h3>Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Anatomy & Chemistry:</span> Normally humans have four parathyroid glands located behind the thyroid gland. PTH is synthesized and secreted by the <b>chief cells</b>. It is a polypeptide (84 amino acids, MW 9500).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Effects on Calcium & Phosphate:</span> PTH provides a powerful mechanism for controlling extracellular calcium and phosphate concentrations. • <b>Increases plasma calcium concentration.</b> • <b>Decreases plasma phosphate concentration.</b></p>
<p><span class="topic">Mobilization from Bone:</span> <b>1. Rapid Phase (Osteolysis):</b> Begins in minutes. PTH activates the osteocytic membrane system (osteocytes and osteoblasts). It stimulates the calcium pump, causing rapid removal of calcium phosphate salts from the amorphous bone crystals that lie near the cells. This occurs without resorption of the bone's fibrous matrix. <b>2. Slow Phase (Bone Resorption):</b> Requires days/weeks. PTH activates osteoclasts. Since osteoclasts do not have PTH receptors, activated osteoblasts send secondary signals (RANKL) to osteoclasts. This leads to proliferation of osteoclasts and greatly increased osteoclastic resorption of bone.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Renal Effects:</span> PTH increases renal tubular reabsorption of calcium (mainly in late distal tubules and collecting ducts). It also increases reabsorption of magnesium ions and hydrogen ions. Importantly, it <b>decreases reabsorption of phosphate ions</b> (in proximal tubules), causing rapid loss of phosphate in the urine (phosphaturia).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Intestinal Effects:</span> PTH greatly enhances both calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines by increasing the formation of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the kidneys.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Control of Secretion:</span> Secretion is controlled by extracellular fluid calcium concentration via a <b>calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)</b> in parathyroid cell membranes. Even the slightest decrease in calcium stimulates PTH secretion within minutes. Persistent low calcium causes hypertrophy of the glands (e.g., in rickets, pregnancy, lactation). Excess calcium decreases gland activity and size.</p>

<h3>Calcitonin</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Source & Stimulus:</span> Secreted by the <b>parafollicular cells (C cells)</b> of the thyroid gland. The primary stimulus for secretion is <b>increased</b> extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration (contrast with PTH).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Actions:</span> Calcitonin decreases plasma calcium concentration. (1) Immediate effect: Decreases absorptive activities of osteoclasts. (2) Prolonged effect: Decreases formation of new osteoclasts.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Significance:</span> Calcitonin has a weak effect on plasma calcium concentration in adult humans because basal osteoclastic absorption is slow, and any initial reduction in calcium leads to powerful stimulation of PTH secretion, which overrides the calcitonin effect. It is more significant in children where bone remodeling is rapid.</p>

<h3>Pathophysiology of Bone and Calcium</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Hypoparathyroidism:</span> <b>Cause:</b> Usually removal of parathyroid glands. <b>Effects:</b> Calcium falls to 6-7 mg/dl; phosphate rises. Osteocytic resorption decreases; osteoclasts become inactive. <b>Symptoms:</b> Signs of <b>tetany</b> develop (laryngeal muscle spasm obstructs respiration causing death). <b>Treatment:</b> Extremely large quantities of Vitamin D and calcium (PTH is expensive and short-acting).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Primary Hyperparathyroidism:</span> <b>Cause:</b> Abnormality of the glands, usually a tumor. More frequent in women. <b>Effects:</b> Extreme osteoclastic activity. High plasma calcium (hypercalcemia) and usually low phosphate. <b>Bone Disease:</b> Extensive decalcification and large punched-out cystic areas filled with osteoclasts (<b>osteitis fibrosa cystica</b>). High plasma <b>alkaline phosphatase</b> (diagnostic finding due to compensatory osteoblastic activity). <b>Systemic Effects:</b> Depression of CNS/PNS, muscle weakness, constipation, abdominal pain, peptic ulcer, lack of appetite, depressed heart relaxation. <b>Metastatic Calcification:</b> If calcium rises above 17 mg/dl (Parathyroid Poisoning), calcium phosphate crystals precipitate in alveoli of lungs, kidney tubules, thyroid, stomach mucosa, and arteries. <b>Kidney Stones:</b> Extreme tendency to form calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate stones due to high excretion.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:</span> High levels of PTH occur as a compensation for hypocalcemia rather than as a primary abnormality. Caused by Vitamin D deficiency or chronic renal disease (damaged kidneys cannot form active Vitamin D).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Rickets:</span> Occurs mainly in children due to calcium or phosphate deficiency, usually caused by <b>Vitamin D deficiency</b> (lack of sunlight). Plasma calcium is only slightly depressed (maintained by PTH bone resorption), but phosphate is greatly depressed. PTH increases, causing extreme bone resorption. Osteoblasts lay down osteoid which does not calcify (weak bones). Tetany occurs in late stages when bone calcium is exhausted.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Osteomalacia:</span> "Adult Rickets". Often caused by steatorrhea (failure to absorb fat and fat-soluble Vitamin D) or "Renal Rickets" (kidney damage).</p>
<p><span class="topic">Osteoporosis:</span> The most common bone disease in adults (especially old age). Results from diminished <b>organic bone matrix</b> rather than poor calcification. Osteoblastic activity is depressed. Common causes: (1) Lack of physical stress (inactivity). (2) Malnutrition (protein). (3) Lack of Vitamin C (necessary for osteoid secretion). (4) Postmenopausal lack of estrogen (estrogens decrease osteoclast activity). (5) Old age (low growth hormone). (6) Cushing's syndrome (glucocorticoids depress osteoblastic activity).</p>

<h3>Physiology of the Teeth</h3>
<p><span class="topic">Functional Parts:</span> <b>Enamel:</b> Outer surface. Formed by <b>ameloblasts</b> before eruption. Composed of large, dense hydroxyapatite crystals embedded in a fine meshwork of strong protein fibers (similar to keratin). Extremely hard and resistant to acids, enzymes, and corrosive agents. <b>Dentin:</b> Main body of the tooth. Strong bony structure. Hydroxyapatite crystals + collagen fibers. Does not contain cells/vessels. Deposited and nourished by <b>odontoblasts</b> lining the pulp cavity. Tubules penetrate dentin for mineral exchange. <b>Cementum:</b> Bony substance secreted by cells of the periodontal membrane lining the tooth socket. Collagen fibers pass from jaw bone through membrane into cementum, holding tooth in place. <b>Pulp:</b> Connective tissue with abundant nerve fibers, blood vessels, and lymphatics filling the pulp cavity.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Dentition & Eruption:</span> Humans have two sets: <b>Deciduous (milk) teeth</b> (20 teeth, erupt 7th month to 2nd year) and <b>Permanent teeth</b> (28-32 teeth). Permanent teeth push outward, eroding roots of deciduous teeth. Tooth-producing organ develops from dental lamina. Metabolic factors (thyroid hormone, growth hormone, availability of calcium/phosphate/Vitamin D, PTH) influence rate of development and calcification.</p>
<p><span class="topic">Abnormalities:</span> <b>Caries:</b> Erosion of teeth. Caused by bacteria (especially <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>) in plaque. Bacteria depend on carbohydrates; they form acids (lactic acid) and proteolytic enzymes. Acids dissolve calcium salts; enzymes digest organic matrix. Frequency of eating carbohydrates is more important than quantity. <b>Role of Fluorine:</b> Teeth formed with small amounts of fluorine develop enamel that is about 3 times more resistant to caries. Fluorine ions replace hydroxyl ions in hydroxyapatite crystals, making enamel less soluble. Fluorine is toxic to bacteria. Fluorine promotes deposition of calcium phosphate to heal enamel. <b>Malocclusion:</b> Hereditary failure of teeth to interdigitate properly. Corrected by orthodontist applying prolonged gentle pressure; this causes absorption of alveolar jaw bone on the compressed side and deposition of new bone on the tensional side, moving the tooth.</p>

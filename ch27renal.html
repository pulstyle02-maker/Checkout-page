        <!-- SECTION 1 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">1. Glomerular Filtration Basics</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Glomerular Filtration—The First Step in Urine Formation</h2>
                <p>The first step in urine formation is filtration of large amounts of fluid through the glomerular capillaries into Bowman’s capsule—almost <span class="highlight">180 L/day</span>. Most of this filtrate is reabsorbed, leaving only about <span class="highlight">1 liter</span> of fluid to be excreted each day, although the renal fluid excretion rate is highly variable, depending on fluid intake.</p>
                <p>The high rate of glomerular filtration depends on a <span class="highlight">high rate of kidney blood flow</span>, as well as the special properties of the glomerular capillary membranes. In this chapter, we discuss the physical forces that determine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as the physiological mechanisms that regulate GFR and renal blood flow.</p>

                <h2>Composition of the Glomerular Filtrate</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Like most capillaries, the glomerular capillaries are relatively impermeable to proteins, so the filtered fluid (called the <strong>glomerular filtrate</strong>) is essentially protein-free and devoid of cellular elements, including red blood cells.</li>
                    <li>The concentrations of other constituents of the glomerular filtrate, including most salts and organic molecules, are similar to the concentrations in the plasma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exceptions to this generalization:</strong> Include a few low-molecular-weight substances such as <span class="highlight">calcium and fatty acids</span> that are not freely filtered because they are partially bound to the plasma proteins.</li>
                    <li>For example, almost half of the plasma calcium and most of the plasma fatty acids are bound to proteins, and these bound portions are not filtered through the glomerular capillaries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>GFR is About 20% of Renal Plasma Flow</h2>
                <p>Similar to other capillaries, the glomerular capillaries filter fluid at a rate that is determined by the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(1) The balance of hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces acting across the capillary membrane.</li>
                    <li>(2) The capillary filtration coefficient (<span class="highlight">Kf</span>), the product of the permeability and filtering surface area of the capillaries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The glomerular capillaries have a much higher rate of filtration than most other capillaries because of a high glomerular hydrostatic pressure and a large Kf. In the average adult human, the GFR is about <span class="highlight">125 ml/min</span>, or 180 L/day. The fraction of the renal plasma flow that is filtered (the filtration fraction) averages about 0.2, which means that about 20% of the plasma flowing through the kidney is filtered through the glomerular capillaries.</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">
                    Filtration fraction = GFR / Renal plasma flow
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">2. The Glomerular Capillary Membrane</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The glomerular capillary membrane is similar to that of other capillaries, except that it has three (instead of the usual two) major layers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(1) The <span class="highlight">endothelium</span> of the capillary.</li>
                    <li>(2) A <span class="highlight">basement membrane</span>.</li>
                    <li>(3) A layer of <span class="highlight">epithelial cells (podocytes)</span> surrounding the outer surface of the capillary basement membrane.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Together, these layers make up the filtration barrier, which, despite the three layers, filters several hundred times as much water and solutes as the usual capillary membrane. Even with this high rate of filtration, the glomerular capillary membrane normally filters only a small amount of plasma proteins.</p>

                <h3>Special Characteristics of the Layers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Capillary Endothelium:</strong> Is perforated by thousands of small holes called <span class="highlight">fenestrae</span>, similar to the fenestrated capillaries found in the liver, although smaller than the fenestrae of the liver. Although the fenestrations are relatively large, endothelial cell proteins are richly endowed with <strong>fixed negative charges</strong> that hinder the passage of plasma proteins.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Basement Membrane:</strong> Surrounding the endothelium, which consists of a meshwork of collagen and proteoglycan fibrillae that have large spaces through which large amounts of water and small solutes can filter. The basement membrane greatly hinders filtration of plasma proteins, partly because of <strong>strong negative electrical charges</strong> associated with the proteoglycans.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Epithelial Cells (Podocytes):</strong> The final part of the glomerular membrane is a layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) that line the outer surface of the glomerulus. These podocytes are not continuous but have long footlike processes (<span class="highlight">pedicels</span>) that encircle the outer surface of the capillaries. The foot processes are separated by gaps called <strong>slit pores</strong> through which the glomerular filtrate moves. The epithelial cells, which also have negative charges, provide additional restriction to filtration of plasma proteins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus, all layers of the glomerular capillary wall provide a barrier to the filtration of plasma proteins but permit rapid filtration of water and most solutes in the plasma.</p>

                <h2>Filterability of Solutes Inversely Related to Their Size</h2>
                <p>The glomerular capillary membrane is thicker than most other capillaries, but it is also much more porous and therefore filters fluid at a high rate. Despite the high filtration rate, the glomerular filtration barrier is selective in determining which molecules will be filtered, based on their size and electrical charge.</p>
                <p>A filterability of 1.0 means that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas a filterability of 0.75 means that the substance is filtered only 75% as rapidly as water. Note that electrolytes such as sodium and small organic compounds such as glucose are freely filtered. As the molecular weight of the molecule approaches that of albumin, the filterability rapidly decreases, approaching zero.</p>

                <h2>Role of Electrical Charge</h2>
                <p><strong>Negatively Charged Large Molecules Are Filtered Less Easily Than Positively Charged Molecules of Equal Molecular Size.</strong></p>
                <p>The molecular diameter of the plasma protein albumin is only about 6 nanometers, whereas the pores of the glomerular membrane are thought to be about 8 nanometers (80 angstroms [Å]). Albumin is restricted from filtration, however, because of its <span class="highlight">negative charge</span> and the electrostatic repulsion exerted by negative charges of the glomerular capillary wall proteoglycans.</p>
                <p>Figure 27-3 shows how electrical charge affects the filtration of different molecular weight dextrans by the glomerulus. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative or positive charges. Note that for any given molecular radius, <strong>positively charged molecules</strong> are filtered much more readily than negatively charged molecules. Neutral dextrans are also filtered more readily than negatively charged dextrans of equal molecular weight. The reason for these differences in filterability is that the negative charges of the basement membrane and podocytes provide an important means for restricting large negatively charged molecules, including the plasma proteins.</p>

                <div class="pathology-card">
                    <h3>Minimal-Change Nephropathy and Increased Permeability</h3>
                    <p>In minimal-change nephropathy, the glomeruli become more permeable to plasma proteins, even though they may look normal when viewed with a standard light microscope. However, when viewed at high magnification with an electron microscope, the glomeruli usually display flattened podocytes with foot processes that may be detached from the glomerular basement membrane (<span class="highlight">podocyte effacement</span>).</p>
                    <p>The causes of minimal change nephropathy are unclear but may be at least partly related to an immunological response and abnormal T-cell secretion of cytokines that injure the podocytes and increase their permeability to some of the lower molecular weight proteins, especially albumin. This increased permeability permits the proteins to be filtered by the glomerular capillaries and excreted in the urine, a condition known as <strong>proteinuria</strong> or <strong>albuminuria</strong>. Minimal change nephropathy is most common in young children but can also occur in adults, especially in those who have autoimmune disorders.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">3. Determinants of GFR</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The GFR is determined by the following: (1) the sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces across the glomerular membrane, which gives the <strong>net filtration pressure</strong>; and (2) the glomerular Kf. Expressed mathematically, the GFR equals the product of Kf and the net filtration pressure:</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">
                    GFR = Kf × Net filtration pressure
                </div>

                <p>The net filtration pressure represents the sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor or oppose filtration across the glomerular capillaries. These forces include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(1) Hydrostatic pressure inside the glomerular capillaries (glomerular hydrostatic pressure, <span class="highlight">PG</span>), which promotes filtration;</li>
                    <li>(2) The hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule (<span class="highlight">PB</span>) outside the capillaries, which opposes filtration;</li>
                    <li>(3) The colloid osmotic pressure of the glomerular capillary plasma proteins (<span class="highlight">πG</span>), which opposes filtration; and</li>
                    <li>(4) The colloid osmotic pressure of the proteins in Bowman’s capsule (<span class="highlight">πB</span>), which promotes filtration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Under normal conditions, the concentration of protein in the glomerular filtrate is so low that the colloid osmotic pressure of the Bowman’s capsule fluid is considered to be zero.</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">

            <div class="panel">
                <h2>1. Increased Glomerular Capillary Filtration Coefficient (Kf) Increases GFR</h2>
                <p>The Kf is a measure of the product of the hydraulic conductivity and surface area of the glomerular capillaries. The Kf cannot be measured directly, but can be estimated experimentally by dividing the GFR by the net filtration pressure: <code>Kf = GFR/Net filtration pressure</code>. Because the total GFR for both kidneys is about 125 ml/min, and the net filtration pressure is 10 mm Hg, the normal Kf is calculated to be about <span class="highlight">12.5 ml/min per mm Hg</span> of filtration pressure.</p>
                <p>When Kf is expressed per 100 grams of kidney weight, it averages about 4.2 ml/min per mm Hg, a value about 400 times as high as the Kf of most other capillary systems of the body. The average Kf of many other tissues in the body is only about 0.01 ml/min per mm Hg/100 g. This high Kf for the glomerular capillaries contributes to their rapid rate of fluid filtration.</p>
                <p>Although increased Kf raises the GFR and decreased Kf reduces the GFR, changes in Kf probably do not provide a primary mechanism for the normal daily regulation of GFR. Some diseases, however, lower Kf by reducing the number of functional glomerular capillaries (thereby reducing the surface area for filtration) or by increasing the thickness of the glomerular capillary membrane and reducing its hydraulic conductivity. For example, chronic uncontrolled hypertension may gradually reduce Kf by increasing the thickness of the glomerular capillary basement membrane and, eventually, by damaging the capillaries so severely that there is loss of capillary function.</p>

                <h2>2. Increased Bowman’s Capsule Hydrostatic Pressure Decreases GFR</h2>
                <p>Direct measurements of hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule and at different points in the proximal tubule in experimental animals using micropipettes have suggested that a reasonable estimate for Bowman’s capsule pressure in humans is about <span class="highlight">18 mm Hg</span> under normal conditions. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule reduces GFR, whereas decreasing this pressure raises GFR. However, changes in Bowman’s capsule pressure normally do not serve as a primary means for regulating GFR.</p>
                <p>In certain pathological states associated with obstruction of the urinary tract, Bowman’s capsule pressure can increase markedly, causing serious reduction of GFR. For example, precipitation of calcium or of uric acid may lead to formation of stones that lodge in the urinary tract, often in the ureter, thereby obstructing outflow of the urinary tract and raising Bowman’s capsule pressure. This situation reduces GFR and eventually can cause <span class="highlight">hydronephrosis</span> (distention and dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces) and can damage or even destroy the kidney unless the obstruction is relieved.</p>

                <h2>3. Increased Glomerular Capillary Colloid Osmotic Pressure Decreases GFR</h2>
                <p>As blood passes from the afferent arteriole through the glomerular capillaries to the efferent arterioles, the plasma protein concentration increases about 20%. The reason for this increase is that about one-fifth of the fluid in the capillaries filters into Bowman’s capsule, thereby concentrating the glomerular plasma proteins that are not filtered. Assuming that the normal colloid osmotic pressure of plasma entering the glomerular capillaries is 28 mm Hg, this value usually rises to about 36 mm Hg by the time the blood reaches the efferent end of the capillaries. Therefore, the average colloid osmotic pressure of the glomerular capillary plasma proteins is midway between 28 and 36 mm Hg, or about 32 mm Hg.</p>
                <p>Two factors that influence the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure are the following: (1) the arterial plasma colloid osmotic pressure; and (2) the fraction of plasma filtered by the glomerular capillaries (filtration fraction). Increasing the arterial plasma colloid osmotic pressure raises the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure, which in turn tends to decrease the GFR.</p>
                <p>Increasing the filtration fraction also concentrates the plasma proteins and raises the glomerular colloid osmotic pressure. Because the filtration fraction is defined as the GFR divided by the renal plasma flow, the filtration fraction can be increased by raising the GFR or by reducing renal plasma flow. For example, a reduction in renal plasma flow with no initial change in GFR would tend to increase the filtration fraction, which would raise the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and tend to reduce the GFR. For this reason, changes in renal blood flow can influence GFR independently of changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure.</p>
                <p>With increasing renal blood flow, a lower fraction of the plasma is initially filtered out of the glomerular capillaries, causing a slower rise in the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and less inhibitory effect on the GFR. Consequently, even with a constant glomerular hydrostatic pressure, a greater rate of blood flow into the glomerulus tends to increase the GFR and a lower rate of blood flow into the glomerulus tends to decrease the GFR.</p>

                <h2>4. Increased Glomerular Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure Increases GFR</h2>
                <p>The glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure has been estimated to be about <span class="highlight">60 mm Hg</span> under normal conditions. Changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure serve as the primary means for physiological regulation of GFR. Increases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure raise the GFR, whereas decreases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure reduce the GFR. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure is determined by three variables, each of which is under physiological control: (1) arterial pressure; (2) afferent arteriolar resistance; and (3) efferent arteriolar resistance.</p>
                
                <h3>Arterial Pressure</h3>
                <p>Increased arterial pressure tends to raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, therefore, to increase the GFR. However, as discussed later, this effect is buffered by autoregulatory mechanisms that maintain a relatively constant glomerular pressure as arterial pressure fluctuates.</p>

                <h3>Afferent Arteriolar Resistance</h3>
                <p>Increased resistance of afferent arterioles reduces glomerular hydrostatic pressure and decreases the GFR. Conversely, dilation of the afferent arterioles increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR.</p>

                <h3>Efferent Arteriolar Resistance</h3>
                <p>Constriction of the efferent arterioles increases the resistance to outflow from the glomerular capillaries. This mechanism raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, as long as the increase in efferent resistance does not reduce renal blood flow too much, GFR increases slightly. However, because efferent arteriolar constriction also reduces renal blood flow, filtration fraction and glomerular colloid osmotic pressure increase as efferent arteriolar resistance increases.</p>
                <p>Therefore, if constriction of efferent arterioles is severe (more than about a threefold increase in efferent arteriolar resistance), the rise in colloid osmotic pressure exceeds the increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure caused by efferent arteriolar constriction. When this situation occurs, the net force for filtration actually decreases, causing a reduction in GFR.</p>
                <p>Thus, efferent arteriolar constriction has a <span class="highlight">biphasic effect</span> on GFR. At moderate levels of constriction, there is a slight increase in GFR but, with severe constriction, there is a decrease in GFR. The primary cause of the eventual decrease in GFR is as follows. As efferent constriction becomes severe, and as plasma protein concentration increases, there is a rapid nonlinear increase in colloid osmotic pressure caused by the <span class="highlight">Donnan effect</span>; the higher the protein concentration, the more rapidly the colloid osmotic pressure rises because of the interaction of ions bound to the plasma proteins, which also exert an osmotic effect.</p>
                <p>To summarize, constriction of afferent arterioles reduces GFR. However, the effect of efferent arteriolar constriction depends on the severity of the constriction; modest efferent constriction raises GFR, but severe efferent constriction (more than a threefold increase in resistance) tends to reduce GFR.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">5. Renal Blood Flow</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>In a 70-kg man, the combined blood flow through both kidneys is about 1100 ml/min, or about 22% of the cardiac output. Considering that the two kidneys constitute only about 0.4% of the total body weight, one can readily see that they receive extremely high blood flow compared with other organs. As with other tissues, blood flow supplies the kidneys with nutrients and removes waste products. However, the high blood flow to the kidneys greatly exceeds this need. The purpose of this additional flow is to supply enough plasma for the high rates of glomerular filtration that are necessary for precise regulation of body fluid volumes and solute concentrations. As might be expected, the mechanisms that regulate renal blood flow are closely linked to control of GFR and excretory functions of the kidneys.</p>

                <h2>Renal Blood Flow and Oxygen Consumption</h2>
                <p>On a per gram-weight basis, the kidneys normally consume oxygen at twice the rate of the brain but have almost seven times the blood flow of the brain. Thus, the oxygen delivered to the kidneys far exceeds their metabolic needs, and the arterial-venous extraction of oxygen is relatively low compared with that of most other tissues.</p>
                <p>A large fraction of the oxygen consumed by the kidneys is related to the high rate of <span class="highlight">active sodium reabsorption</span> by the renal tubules. If renal blood flow and GFR are reduced, and less sodium is filtered, less sodium is reabsorbed and less oxygen is consumed. Therefore, renal oxygen consumption varies in proportion to renal tubular sodium reabsorption, which in turn is closely related to GFR and the rate of sodium filtered. If glomerular filtration ceases completely, renal sodium reabsorption also ceases and oxygen consumption decreases to about one-fourth normal. This residual oxygen consumption reflects the basic metabolic needs of the renal cells.</p>

                <h2>Determinants of Renal Blood Flow</h2>
                <p>Renal blood flow (RBF) is determined by the pressure gradient across the renal vasculature (the difference between renal artery and renal vein hydrostatic pressures), divided by the total renal vascular resistance:</p>
                <div class="formula-box">
                    RBF = (Renal artery pressure − Renal vein pressure) / Total renal vascular resistance
                </div>
                <p>Renal artery pressure is about equal to systemic arterial pressure, and renal vein pressure averages about 3 to 4 mm Hg under most conditions. As in other vascular beds, the total vascular resistance through the kidneys is determined by the sum of the resistances in the individual vasculature segments, including the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins. Most of the renal vascular resistance resides in three major segments—interlobular arteries, afferent arterioles, and efferent arterioles. Resistance of these vessels is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, various hormones, and local internal renal control mechanisms, as discussed later.</p>
                <p>An increase in the resistance of any of the vascular segments of the kidneys tends to reduce the renal blood flow, whereas a decrease in vascular resistance increases renal blood flow if renal artery and renal vein pressures remain constant. Although changes in arterial pressure have some influence on renal blood flow, the kidneys have effective mechanisms for maintaining renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant over an arterial pressure range between 80 and 170 mm Hg, a process called <span class="highlight">autoregulation</span>. This capacity for autoregulation occurs through mechanisms that are intrinsic to the kidneys, as discussed later in this chapter.</p>

                <h2>Blood Flow in Vasa Recta of Renal Medulla</h2>
                <p>The outer part of the kidney, the renal cortex, receives most of the kidney’s blood flow. Blood flow in the renal medulla accounts for only <span class="highlight">1% to 2%</span> of the total renal blood flow. Flow to the renal medulla is supplied by a specialized portion of the peritubular capillary system called the <span class="highlight">vasa recta</span>. These vessels descend into the medulla in parallel with the loops of Henle and then loop back along with the loops of Henle and return to the cortex before emptying into the venous system. As discussed in Chapter 29, the vasa recta play an important role in allowing the kidneys to form concentrated urine.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 6 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">6. Physiological Control of GFR and RBF</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The determinant of GFR that is most variable and subject to physiological control is the glomerular hydrostatic pressure. This variable, in turn, is influenced by the sympathetic nervous system, hormones, autacoids (vasoactive substances that are released in the kidneys and act locally), and other feedback controls that are intrinsic to the kidneys.</p>

                <h2>Strong Sympathetic Nervous System Activation Decreases GFR</h2>
                <p>Essentially all the blood vessels of the kidneys, including the afferent and efferent arterioles, are richly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers. Strong activation of the renal sympathetic nerves can constrict the renal arterioles and decrease renal blood flow and GFR. Moderate or mild sympathetic stimulation has little influence on renal blood flow and GFR. For example, reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system resulting from moderate decreases in pressure at the carotid sinus baroreceptors or cardiopulmonary receptors has little influence on renal blood flow or GFR. However, as discussed in Chapter 28, even mild increases in renal sympathetic activity can stimulate renin release and increase renal tubular reabsorption, causing decreased sodium and water excretion. The renal sympathetic nerves seem to be the most important in reducing GFR during severe acute disturbances lasting for a few minutes to a few hours, such as those elicited by the defense reaction, brain ischemia, or severe hemorrhage.</p>

                <h2>Hormonal and Autacoid Control of Renal Circulation</h2>
                
                <h3>Norepinephrine, Epinephrine, and Endothelin</h3>
                <p>Hormones that constrict afferent and efferent arterioles, causing reductions in GFR and renal blood flow, include norepinephrine and epinephrine released from the adrenal medulla. In general, blood levels of these hormones parallel the activity of the sympathetic nervous system; thus, norepinephrine and epinephrine have little influence on renal hemodynamics except under conditions associated with strong activation of the sympathetic nervous system, such as severe hemorrhage.</p>
                <p>Another vasoconstrictor, <span class="highlight">endothelin</span>, is a peptide that can be released by damaged vascular endothelial cells of the kidneys, as well as by other tissues. The physiological role of this autacoid is not completely understood. However, endothelin may contribute to hemostasis (minimizing blood loss) when a blood vessel is severed, which damages the endothelium and releases this powerful vasoconstrictor. Plasma endothelin levels are also increased in many disease states associated with vascular injury, such as toxemia of pregnancy, acute renal failure, and chronic uremia, and may contribute to renal vasoconstriction and decreased GFR in some of these pathophysiological conditions.</p>

                <h3>Angiotensin II Preferentially Constricts Efferent Arterioles</h3>
                <p>A powerful renal vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II, can be considered to be a circulating hormone and a locally produced autacoid or paracrine hormone because it is formed in the kidneys and in the systemic circulation. Receptors for angiotensin II are present in virtually all blood vessels of the kidneys. However, the preglomerular blood vessels, especially the afferent arterioles, appear to be relatively protected from angiotensin II–mediated constriction in most physiological conditions associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system, such as during a low-sodium diet or reduced renal perfusion pressure due to renal artery stenosis. This protection is due to release of vasodilators, especially nitric oxide and prostaglandins, which counteract the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II in these blood vessels. The efferent arterioles, however, are highly sensitive to angiotensin II.</p>
                <p>Because angiotensin II preferentially constricts efferent arterioles in most physiological conditions, increased angiotensin II levels raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure while reducing renal blood flow. It should be kept in mind that increased angiotensin II formation usually occurs in circumstances associated with decreased arterial pressure or volume depletion, which tend to decrease GFR. In these circumstances, the increased level of angiotensin II, by constricting efferent arterioles, helps prevent decreases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR. At the same time, though, the reduction in renal blood flow caused by efferent arteriolar constriction contributes to decreased flow through the peritubular capillaries, which in turn increases the reabsorption of sodium and water, as discussed in Chapter 28.</p>
                <p>Thus, increased angiotensin II levels that occur with a low-sodium diet or volume depletion help maintain GFR and normal excretion of metabolic waste products, such as urea and creatinine, which depend on glomerular filtration for their excretion. At the same time, the angiotensin II–induced constriction of efferent arterioles increases tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, which helps restore blood volume and blood pressure. This effect of angiotensin II in helping autoregulate GFR is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

                <h3>Endothelial-Derived Nitric Oxide</h3>
                <p>An autacoid that decreases renal vascular resistance and is released by the vascular endothelium throughout the body is endothelial-derived nitric oxide. A basal level of nitric oxide production appears to be important for maintaining vasodilation of the kidneys and normal excretion of sodium and water. Therefore, administration of drugs that inhibit formation of nitric oxide increases renal vascular resistance and decreases GFR and urinary sodium excretion, eventually causing high blood pressure. In some hypertensive patients or in patients with atherosclerosis, damage of the vascular endothelium and impaired nitric oxide production may contribute to increased renal vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure.</p>

                <h3>Prostaglandins and Bradykinin</h3>
                <p>Prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) and bradykinin serve as hormones and autacoids that cause vasodilation, increased renal blood flow, and increased GFR. Although these vasodilators do not appear to be of major importance in regulating renal blood flow or the GFR in normal conditions, they may dampen the renal vasoconstrictor effects of the sympathetic nerves or angiotensin II, especially their effects to constrict the afferent arterioles. By opposing vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles, the prostaglandins help prevent excessive reductions in GFR and renal blood flow. Under stressful conditions, such as volume depletion or after surgery, the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis may cause significant reductions in GFR.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 7 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">7. Autoregulation</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Feedback mechanisms intrinsic to the kidneys normally keep renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant, despite marked changes in arterial blood pressure. These mechanisms still function in blood-perfused kidneys that have been removed from the body, independent of systemic influences. This relative constancy of GFR and renal blood flow is referred to as <span class="highlight">autoregulation</span>.</p>
                <p>The primary function of blood flow autoregulation in most tissues, other than the kidneys, is to maintain the delivery of oxygen and nutrients at a normal level and remove the waste products of metabolism, despite changes in the arterial pressure. In the kidneys, the normal blood flow is much higher than that required for these functions. The major function of autoregulation in the kidneys is to maintain a relatively constant GFR and allow precise control of renal excretion of water and solutes. The GFR normally remains relatively constant, despite considerable arterial pressure fluctuations that occur during a person’s usual activities. For example, a decrease in arterial pressure to as low as 70 to 75 mm Hg or an increase to as high as 160 to 180 mm Hg usually changes the GFR less than 10%. In general, renal blood flow is autoregulated in parallel with GFR, but GFR is more efficiently autoregulated under certain conditions.</p>

                <h2>Importance of GFR Autoregulation</h2>
                <p>Although the renal autoregulatory mechanisms are not perfect, they do prevent potentially large changes in GFR and renal excretion of water and solutes that would otherwise occur with changes in blood pressure. One can understand the quantitative importance of autoregulation by considering the relative magnitudes of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and renal excretion and the changes in renal excretion that would occur without autoregulatory mechanisms.</p>
                <p>Normally, GFR is about 180 L/day, and tubular reabsorption is 178.5 L/day, leaving 1.5 L/day of fluid to be excreted in the urine. In the absence of autoregulation, a relatively small increase in blood pressure (from 100 to 125 mm Hg) would cause a similar 25% increase in GFR (from about 180 to 225 L/day). If tubular reabsorption remained constant at 178.5 L/day, the urine flow would increase to 46.5 L/day (the difference between GFR and tubular reabsorption)—a total increase in urine of more than 30-fold. Because the total plasma volume is only about 3 liters, such a change would quickly deplete the blood volume.</p>
                <p>In reality, changes in arterial pressure usually exert much less of an effect on urine volume for two reasons: (1) renal autoregulation prevents large changes in GFR that would otherwise occur; and (2) there are additional adaptive mechanisms in the renal tubules that cause them to increase their reabsorption rate when GFR rises, a phenomenon referred to as <span class="highlight">glomerulotubular balance</span>. Even with these special control mechanisms, changes in arterial pressure still have significant effects on renal excretion of water and sodium; this effect is referred to as pressure diuresis or pressure natriuresis, and it is crucial in the regulation of body fluid volumes and arterial pressure, as discussed in Chapters 19 and 30.</p>

                <h2>Tubuloglomerular Feedback and Autoregulation of GFR</h2>
                <p>The kidneys have a special feedback mechanism that links changes in the sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal arteriolar resistance and autoregulation of GFR. This feedback helps ensure a relatively constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur. In many circumstances, this feedback autoregulates renal blood flow and GFR in parallel. However, because this mechanism is specifically directed toward stabilizing sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule, instances occur when GFR is autoregulated at the expense of changes in renal blood flow, as discussed later. In other cases, this mechanism may actually cause changes in GFR in response to primary changes in renal tubular sodium chloride reabsorption.</p>
                <p>The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR: (1) an afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism; and (2) an efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism. These feedback mechanisms depend on special anatomical arrangements of the <span class="highlight">juxtaglomerular complex</span>.</p>
                <p>The juxtaglomerular complex consists of macula densa cells in the initial portion of the distal tubule and juxtaglomerular cells in the walls of the afferent and efferent arterioles. The <span class="highlight">macula densa</span> is a specialized group of epithelial cells in the distal tubules that comes in close contact with the afferent and efferent arterioles. The macula densa cells contain the Golgi apparatus, which consists of intracellular secretory organelles directed toward the arterioles, suggesting that these cells may be secreting a substance toward the arterioles.</p>

                <h3>Decreased Macula Densa Sodium Chloride Causes Dilation of Afferent Arterioles and Increased Renin Release</h3>
                <p>The macula densa cells sense changes in sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule by way of signals that are not completely understood. Experimental studies have suggested that a decreased GFR slows the flow rate in the loop of Henle, causing increased reabsorption of the percentage of sodium and chloride ions delivered to the ascending loop of Henle and thereby reducing the concentration of sodium chloride at the macula densa cells. This decrease in sodium chloride concentration initiates a signal from the macula densa that has two effects: (1) it decreases resistance to blood flow in the afferent arterioles, which raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helps return GFR toward normal; and (2) it increases renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles, which are the major storage sites for renin. Renin released from these cells then functions as an enzyme to increase the formation of angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. Finally, angiotensin II constricts the efferent arterioles, thereby increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helping return GFR toward normal.</p>
                <p>These two components of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, operating together by way of the special anatomical structure of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, provide feedback signals to the afferent and efferent arterioles for efficient autoregulation of GFR during changes in arterial pressure. When both of these mechanisms are functioning together, GFR changes by only a few percentage points, even with large fluctuations in arterial pressure between the limits of 75 and 160 mm Hg.</p>

                <h3>Blockade of Angiotensin II Formation Further Reduces GFR During Renal Hypoperfusion</h3>
                <p>As discussed earlier, a preferential constrictor action of angiotensin II on efferent arterioles helps prevent serious reductions in glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR when renal perfusion pressure falls below normal. The administration of drugs that block the formation of angiotensin II (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or that block the action of angiotensin II (angiotensin II receptor antagonists) may cause greater reductions in GFR than usual when the renal arterial pressure falls below normal. Therefore, an important complication of using these drugs to treat patients who have hypertension because of renal artery stenosis (partial blockage of the renal artery) is a severe decrease in GFR that can, in some cases, cause acute renal failure. Nevertheless, angiotensin II–blocking drugs are important therapeutic agents in many patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and other conditions, as long as the patients are monitored to ensure that severe decreases in GFR do not occur.</p>

                <h2>Myogenic Autoregulation</h2>
                <p>Another mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of a relatively constant renal blood flow and GFR is the ability of individual blood vessels to resist stretching during increased arterial pressure, referred to as the <span class="highlight">myogenic mechanism</span>. Studies of individual blood vessels (especially small arterioles) throughout the body have shown that they respond to increased wall tension or wall stretch by contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. Stretch of the vascular wall allows increased movement of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into the cells, causing them to contract through the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 8. This contraction prevents excessive stretch of the vessel and, at the same time, by raising vascular resistance, helps prevent excessive increases in renal blood flow and the GFR when arterial pressure increases.</p>
                <p>Although the myogenic mechanism probably operates in most arterioles throughout the body, its importance in renal blood flow and GFR autoregulation has been questioned by some physiologists because this pressure-sensitive mechanism has no means of directly detecting changes in renal blood flow or GFR per se. On the other hand, this mechanism may be more important in protecting the kidney from hypertension-induced injury. In response to sudden increases in blood pressure, the myogenic constrictor response in afferent arterioles occurs within seconds and therefore attenuates transmission of increased arterial pressure to the glomerular capillaries.</p>

                <h2>High Protein Intake and Hyperglycemia</h2>
                <p>Although renal blood flow and GFR are relatively stable under most conditions, there are circumstances in which these variables change significantly. For example, a <span class="highlight">high protein intake</span> is known to increase renal blood flow and GFR. With a long-term, high-protein diet, such as one that contains large amounts of meat, increases in GFR and renal blood flow are due partly to growth of the kidneys. However, the GFR and renal blood flow also increase 20% to 30% within 1 or 2 hours after a person eats a high-protein meal.</p>
                <p>One likely explanation for the increased GFR is the following. A high-protein meal releases into the blood amino acids, which are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. Because amino acids and sodium are reabsorbed together by cotransport in the proximal tubules, increased amino acid reabsorption also stimulates sodium reabsorption. This increased reabsorption of sodium decreases sodium delivery to the macula densa, which elicits a tubuloglomerular feedback–mediated decrease in resistance of the afferent arterioles, as discussed earlier. The decreased afferent arteriolar resistance then raises renal blood flow and GFR, allowing sodium excretion to be maintained at a nearly normal level while increasing excretion of the waste products of protein metabolism, such as urea.</p>
                <p>A similar mechanism may also explain the marked increases in renal blood flow and the GFR that occur with large increases in blood glucose levels in persons with <span class="highlight">uncontrolled diabetes mellitus</span>. Because glucose, like some of the amino acids, is also reabsorbed along with sodium in the proximal tubule, increased glucose delivery to the tubules causes them to reabsorb excess sodium along with glucose. This increased reabsorption of sodium, in turn, decreases the sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa, activating a tubuloglomerular feedback–mediated dilation of the afferent arterioles and subsequent increases in renal blood flow and GFR.</p>
                <p>These examples demonstrate that renal blood flow and GFR per se are not the primary variables controlled by the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. The main purpose of this feedback is to ensure a constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule, where final processing of the urine takes place. Thus, disturbances that tend to increase the reabsorption of sodium chloride at tubular sites before the macula densa tend to elicit increased renal blood flow and GFR, which helps return distal sodium chloride delivery toward normal so that normal rates of sodium and water excretion can be maintained.</p>
                <p>An opposite sequence of events occurs when proximal tubular reabsorption is reduced. For example, when the proximal tubules are damaged (which can occur as a result of poisoning by heavy metals, such as mercury, or large doses of drugs, such as tetracyclines), their ability to reabsorb sodium chloride is decreased. As a consequence, large amounts of sodium chloride are delivered to the distal tubule and, without appropriate compensation, would quickly cause excessive volume depletion. One of the important compensatory responses appears to be a tubuloglomerular feedback–mediated renal vasoconstriction that occurs in response to the increased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa in these circumstances. These examples again demonstrate the importance of this feedback mechanism for ensuring that the distal tubules receive the proper rate of delivery of sodium chloride, other tubular fluid solutes, and tubular fluid volume so that appropriate amounts of these substances are excreted in the urine.</p>

                <h2>Other Factors</h2>
                <p>The GFR and renal blood flow are low at birth, approach normal adult levels after about 2 years of life, and in the absence of kidney disease, are maintained relatively constant until the fourth decade. Thereafter, GFR declines by about 5% to 10% per decade, although there is considerable variability among individuals. This decline in GFR coincides with nitric oxide deficiency, increased oxidative stress, and loss of functional nephrons, which may be related partly to increasing blood pressure, metabolic disorders, and other insults that cause cumulative glomerular injury with aging.</p>
                <p>Men have higher renal blood flow and GFR than women, even when corrected for body mass. However, men also have a more rapid decline in GFR with aging than premenopausal women. Although the mechanisms responsible for these sex differences are not fully understood, beneficial effects of estrogens and damaging effects of androgens on the kidneys have been suggested as a partial explanation.</p>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> In renal artery stenosis, renal perfusion pressure is low. To maintain GFR, the kidney relies on the Tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism where reduced NaCl delivery to the macula densa stimulates Renin release. This produces Angiotensin II. <br><br>
                        Angiotensin II <strong>preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole</strong>. This constriction increases the outflow resistance, which raises the Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure (PG) despite the low inflow pressure. This maintains the GFR. <br><br>
                        By giving an ACE inhibitor, you block the formation of Angiotensin II. Without efferent constriction, the Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure falls significantly because the inflow pressure is already low (due to stenosis). Consequently, the net filtration pressure drops, GFR collapses, and acute renal failure ensues.

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Phase 1 (Slight Constriction):</strong> Increases resistance to outflow, raising Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure (PG). This increases GFR slightly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Phase 2 (Severe Constriction):</strong> This drastically reduces Renal Blood Flow (RBF). Because RBF is low, the plasma spends more time in the glomerulus, and a higher fraction of plasma is filtered (Increased Filtration Fraction).</li>
                            <li><strong>Result:</strong> As fluid leaves, proteins are left behind. High FF causes a massive increase in protein concentration within the capillary. This spikes the Glomerular Colloid Osmotic Pressure (πG), which opposes filtration.</li>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong> 
                        Normally, high GFR should deliver high NaCl to the macula densa, causing afferent constriction (feedback). However, in hyperglycemia:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Excess glucose is filtered into the tubule.</li>
                            <li>In the <strong>Proximal Tubule</strong>, glucose is reabsorbed via cotransporters that also pull Sodium (Na+) along with it.</li>
                            <li>Because of this massive Na-Glucose cotransport, <strong>excessive amounts of Sodium are reabsorbed</strong> upstream in the proximal tubule.</li>
                            <li>Consequently, the fluid reaching the Distal Tubule (Macula Densa) has a <strong>low concentration of NaCl</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The Macula Densa interprets low NaCl as "Low GFR/Low Blood Flow."</li>
                            <li>It signals the Afferent Arteriole to <strong>dilate</strong> (and stimulates renin release).</li>

                    <div id="ans4" class="answer">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                        Renal Oxygen consumption would drop to approximately <strong>one-fourth (25%)</strong> of normal. <br><br>
                        Unlike the brain, where blood flow and oxygen demand are coupled to tissue metabolism, the kidney's $VO_2$ is determined largely by <strong>active Sodium reabsorption</strong>. 
                        <br><br>
                        Since Sodium is reabsorbed from the filtrate, the amount of work the kidney does depends on how much Sodium is filtered (which depends on GFR). 
                        <br>
                        If GFR = 0, no Sodium is filtered, so no active reabsorption occurs. The remaining 25% of oxygen consumption represents the "basal metabolic rate" required to keep the renal cells alive, independent of their transport work.

                    <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans5')">Show Answer</button>
                    <div id="ans5" class="answer">
                        <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                        Normally, Albumin (diameter ~6nm) is smaller than the glomerular pores (~8nm), so size is not the primary barrier. Albumin is blocked primarily because it is negatively charged, and the proteoglycans in the basement membrane/podocytes are also negatively charged (Electrostatic Repulsion).
                        <br><br>
                        In Minimal Change Nephropathy, there is a loss of these <strong>fixed negative charges</strong> (often due to T-cell cytokine injury causing podocyte effacement). 
                        <br><br>
                        Once the negative charge barrier is removed, the size barrier alone is insufficient to stop Albumin. Albumin is then filtered freely based on its size (which fits through the pores), leading to severe albuminuria.

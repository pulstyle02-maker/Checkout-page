        <!-- SECTION: THE SKIN -->
        <section id="overview">
            <h2>The Skin</h2>
            <p>The skin and its certain specialized derivatives, called appendages, constitute the <strong>integumentary system</strong>. The appendages of skin include hair, nails, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands.</p>
            
            <h3>General Structure</h3>
            <p>The skin (also called <em>integument</em> or <em>cutis</em>) forms the external covering of the body. It consists of two layers of completely different types of tissues that are attached to each other over their entire extent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Epidermis:</strong> The superficial layer. It is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium. Developmentally, the epidermis is derived from the <strong>surface ectoderm</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Dermis (or Corium):</strong> The deeper layer of skin. It is composed of dense, irregular connective tissue and is derived from the <strong>mesoderm</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hypodermis</h3>
            <p>Under the dermis lies the hypodermis, which consists of loose connective tissue containing variable amounts of adipose tissue. The hypodermis binds the skin loosely to the underlying deep fascia (or underlying muscles where the deep fascia is absent) and thus allows the skin to move over the deep fascia (or underlying muscles).</p>
            <p>Generally, the hypodermis is not considered to be a part of the skin, but some histologists regard it as the third layer of skin because it lodges deeper parts of the appendages of skin like hair follicles and sweat glands.</p>

            <h3>Classification: Thick vs. Thin Skin</h3>
            <p>Taking into account the thickness of the epidermis, the skin is classified into two types: thick skin and thin skin.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thick Skin:</strong> Covers palms and soles. The epidermal thickness ranges from <strong>400 to 1400 µm</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Thin Skin:</strong> Is found on the remainder of the body. In the thin skin, the epidermal thickness varies from <strong>75 to 150 µm</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION: EPIDERMIS CELLS - KERATINOCYTES -->
        <section id="keratinocytes">
            <h2>Epidermis: Keratinocytes</h2>
            <p>The epidermis is a continuously self-replacing stratified squamous keratinized epithelium. It contains four types of cells: Keratinocytes, Melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Keratinocytes (Principal Cells)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The most characteristic feature of the keratinocytes is that their cytoplasm is rich in <strong>keratin intermediate filaments</strong> (also known as <em>tonofilaments</em>).</li>
                <li>The protein keratin is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the keratinocytes, and the number of tonofilaments increases as the cells move outwards.</li>
                <li>The keratinocytes undergo constant renewal throughout life by continuous production of new cells by the mitotic division of the keratinocytes located in the basal layer (stratum basale) of the epidermis.</li>
                <li>The newly produced keratinocytes constantly move outward into the more superficial layers of the epidermis.</li>
                <li>As they move away from the basement membrane of the epidermis, the keratinocytes undergo progressive changes in size, shape, and content, eventually transforming from cuboidal living cells to dead flat cells which are constantly shed off (desquamated) from the skin surface.</li>
                <li>As the keratinocytes leave the stratum basale and move outwards, the number of keratin filaments increases and they become aggregated into bundles called <strong>tonofibrils</strong>. In the mature keratinocytes, which occupy the most superficial layers of the epidermis, tonofibrils occupy almost <strong>85%</strong> of the cell volume.</li>
                <li>In the <strong>stratum granulosum</strong> of the epidermis, the keratinocytes begin to form small, oval, membrane-bound granules called <strong>lamellar granules</strong>. These granules consist of concentric lamellae which contain pro-barrier lipids which are secreted into the intercellular spaces in the stratum corneum. These lipids serve to make the epidermis impermeable to water.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION: MELANOCYTES -->
        <section id="melanocytes">
            <h2>Epidermis: Melanocytes</h2>
            
            <h3>2. Melanocytes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>These are stellate cells having oval bodies and long dendritic processes (Fig. 15.1).</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Cell bodies of the melanocytes are located among the keratinocytes of the stratum basale of the epidermis (Fig 15.2).</li>
                <li>Many long, irregular dendritic processes arise from the cell body of each melanocyte and penetrate between the keratinocytes of the stratum basale and stratum spinosum to terminate on <strong>5–10 keratinocytes</strong>.</li>
                <li>The cell bodies of the melanocytes are attached to the basal lamina of the basal lamina by hemidesmosomes, but <strong>no</strong> intercellular junctions exist between the melanocytes and their neighboring keratinocytes.</li>
                <li>The melanocytes are not identifiable in the routine H&E stained sections and special staining procedures are needed to visualize these cells under the light microscope. Electron microscope shows that the cytoplasm of a melanocyte contains numerous mitochondria, a large Golgi apparatus, and well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Melanin Synthesis & Function</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The melanocytes synthesize the brownish-black pigment <strong>melanin</strong>.</li>
                <li>Formation of the melanin pigment occurs within membrane-bound bodies called <em>melanosomes</em>.</li>
                <li>Melanosomes are derived from the Golgi apparatus of the cell and contain the enzyme <strong>tyrosinase</strong>. This enzyme acts on tyrosine to transform it into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) which is subsequently converted into melanin.</li>
                <li>The melanin-packed mature melanosomes are called melanin granules. The mature melanosomes are transferred from the cell body into the dendritic processes of the melanocytes finally reaching the tips of these processes.</li>
                <li>The keratinocytes associated with each melanocyte phagocytose the melanosomes-loaded tips of the dendritic processes. The engulfed melanosomes are transported toward the nucleus of the keratinocyte where they form a cap over the nucleus.</li>
                <li>The melanin caps over the nuclei play a very important protective role. The brownish-black melanin pigment absorbs the ultraviolet rays of the sunlight and thus prevents damage to the DNA of the nuclei of the nonkeratinized cells of the stratum spinosum and stratum basale of the epidermis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Epidermal-Melanin Unit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A melanocyte and the associated 5–10 keratinocytes, to which it transfers melanosomes, collectively constitute an <em>epidermal-melanin unit</em>.</li>
                <li>The average number of these units is similar in all people but the speed of production of melanosomes in the melanocytes varies in different geographical locations.</li>
                <li>The melanocytes in the skin of those people who live near the equator (in the tropical and subtropical regions) produce melanosomes very rapidly to provide greater protection against the UV rays reaching from the Sun.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="clinical">
                <h3>Clinical Application</h3>
                <p><strong>Albinism</strong> is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the melanocytes from producing melanin. The persons suffering from this disorder have very pale skin and white hair. They also suffer from vision problems (due to the absence of melanin in the iris and retina).</p>
                <p><strong>Vitiligo</strong>, also called <em>leukoderma</em>, is an acquired disorder characterized by formation of white patches on the skin. It is a depigmentation disorder in which melanocytes of the skin are lost. Exact cause of vitiligo is not known. The possible cause is genetic susceptibility that becomes triggered by some environmental factors as happens in autoimmune diseases.</p>
                <p>A <strong>nevus</strong>, known commonly as <strong>mole</strong>, is a benign growth on skin formed by a cluster of melanocytes. Nevi are very common and most people have 10-40 moles on their body. Some moles are present since birth but most develop during childhood and adolescence. Nevi can also appear later in life because of excessive exposure to sun. Generally, nevi are harmless, but sometimes a nevus can undergo a malignant change (indicated by changes in size, shape or color) and develop into a malignant tumor known as <strong>malignant melanoma</strong>. Therefore, any mole that begins to enlarge or changes its shape or color must be excised surgically without delay.</p>

        <!-- SECTION: OTHER CELLS -->
        <section id="other-cells">
            <h2>Other Epidermal Cells</h2>

            <h3>3. Langerhans Cells</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Langerhans cells are <strong>antigen-presenting dendritic cells</strong> located in the epidermis and are not identifiable in the ordinary H&E stained sections.</li>
                <li>With special staining techniques, such as gold impregnation, these cells are found to be located mainly in the <strong>stratum spinosum</strong> of the epidermis and each of them is seen to possess several dendritic processes (Fig. 15.2).</li>
                <li>Electron microscopic studies reveal that the cytoplasm of a Langerhans cell contains a small number of mitochondria, sparse RER, but many lysosomes and vesicles.</li>
                <li>The Langerhans cells constitute an important component of the adaptive immune system of the body. As they are present in the epidermis, their location is strategically extremely important. The skin is continuously exposed to microorganisms and also to various antigenic molecules.</li>
                <li>However, these antigens cannot penetrate the skin without encountering the Langerhans cells which are actually immature dendritic cells which can engulf an antigen but cannot process it unless they migrate to a secondary lymphoid organ. Upon capturing an antigen, the Langerhans cells retract their processes, move through the dermis and enter the lymphatic vessels to reach the nearest lymph node where they undergo maturation, process the engulfed antigen and present its epitope to the B and T lymphocytes, so that an appropriate immune response against the concerned antigen is initiated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Merkel Cells</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>These cells, also called tactile epithelial cells, are found to be scattered among the cells of <strong>stratum basale</strong> of epidermis (Fig. 15.2).</li>
                <li>Fine dendritic processes of the Merkel cells extend between the overlying keratinocytes.</li>
                <li>The Merkel cells are especially abundant in the skin of the highly sensitive areas like fingertips and lips.</li>
                <li>A special feature of these cells is the presence of dense-cored granules (80–100 nm in diameter) which contain neurosecretory peptides. Their cytoplasm also contains closely-packed keratin intermediate filaments.</li>
                <li>The basolateral surface of each Merkel cell makes a synaptic junction with the expanded terminal of an afferent nerve fiber. The afferent (sensory) nerve fibers reach the stratum basale by penetrating the basement membrane of the epidermis.</li>
                <li>Combination of the expanded terminal of the afferent nerve fiber and a Merkel cell is referred to as a <strong>Merkel cell-neurite complex</strong> (Fig. 11.7).</li>
                <li>The Merkel cell-neurite complexes serve as mechanoreceptors which are concerned with the sensation of light touch. These sensory nerve endings play an important role in the perception of the texture and shape of various objects.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION: EPIDERMIS LAYERS -->
        <section id="epidermis-layers">
            <h2>Layers of the Epidermis</h2>
            <p>It is important to realize that the structural organization of the epidermis into layers reflects successive stages in the life of a keratinocyte, involving proliferation, growth, outward displacement, and differentiation, followed by death and desquamation.</p>
            <p>When a stained section of thin skin is examined under LM, the epidermis is seen to consist of four layers (Fig. 15.2 & 15.3), whereas five epidermal layers are in a section of thick skin (Fig. 15.4). From deep to superficial, these five layers or strata are named as under:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stratum basale.</li>
                <li>Stratum spinosum.</li>
                <li>Stratum granulosum.</li>
                <li>Stratum lucidum (seen only in thick skin).</li>
                <li>Stratum corneum.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>1. Stratum Basale (Stratum Germinativum)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The stratum basale, i.e., basal layer, of the epidermis consists of a single layer of basophilic cuboidal or low columnar keratinocytes resting on a basement membrane, which lies on the dermis.</li>
                <li>Each cell contains a large, oval nucleus.</li>
                <li>Desmosomes occur frequently at the lateral and outer surfaces of the keratinocytes of the stratum basale and serve to bind these cells to each other and to the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum.</li>
                <li>Hemidesmosomes are found on the basal plasmalemma of the stratum basale keratinocytes; these hemidesmosomes serve to bind these cells to the basement membrane.</li>
                <li>EM shows that the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes of the stratum basale contains a small Golgi complex, a few mitochondria, a small amount of RER, and abundant free ribosomes. The cytoplasm also contains keratin intermediate filaments (<em>tonofilaments</em>). The tonofilaments pass through the plaques of the laterally placed desmosomes, while they end in the plaques of the hemidesmosomes.</li>
                <li>New keratinocytes are produced in the stratum basale by the mitotic division of the keratinocytes of this layer and, therefore, this layer is also known as <em>stratum germinativum</em>.</li>
                <li>The newly produced cells are constantly displaced into the stratum spinosum. In addition to the keratinocytes, the stratum basale contains Merkel cells and cell bodies of the melanocytes (Fig. 15.2). Dendritic processes of the melanocytes extend outward in between the cells of the stratum spinosum.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Stratum Spinosum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The stratum spinosum consists of several layers of keratinocytes. The cells in the deeper layers are polyhedral in shape, while in the superficial layers the keratinocytes are more or less flattened.</li>
                <li>A special feature of the cells of this layer is the presence of numerous fine cytoplasmic processes. Early histologists named these as <strong>‘spines’</strong> and consequently this layer was named stratum spinosum.</li>
                <li>EM shows that the cytoplasmic processes of neighboring cells are joined to each other by desmosomes. These desmosomes strongly bind the cells of stratum spinosum with each other and thus enable them to resist abrasion.</li>
                <li>In addition to the keratinocytes, the stratum spinosum contains Langerhans cells (Fig. 15.2) and occasional lymphocytes.</li>
                <li>In the cytoplasm of keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum, the tonofilaments begin to aggregate to form bundles called <strong>tonofibrils</strong>.</li>
                <li>The cytoplasm of the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum also contains variable number of melanin granules which are transferred to these cells by the dendritic processes of the melanocytes. The number of melanin granules in the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum varies in different persons, being very high in the dark-skinned people.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Stratum Granulosum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The stratum granulosum consists of 3 to 5 layers of flattened rhomboid keratinocytes with their long axes parallel to the surface of the skin.</li>
                <li>The cytoplasm of these cells contains a large number of intensely basophilic large granules called <strong>keratohyalin granules</strong>. These granules are irregular in shape and are not bounded by a membrane. They contain <em>keratohyalin</em> which is a protein complex consisting of <em>filaggrin</em> and some other proteins. These proteins function as promoters of aggregation of tonofilaments into tonofibrils.</li>
                <li>Electron microscopic examination of the keratinocytes of the stratum granulosum shows that they also contain small, oval, membrane-bound granules which exhibit a lamellar (multilayered) structure and, therefore, are called <strong>lamellar granules</strong>. The lamellar granules, also called <em>membrane-coating granules</em>, are produced by the Golgi apparatus of the cell and contain various lipids (chiefly phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and ceramides).</li>
                <li>These granules release their contents by exocytosis and the special lipids so released diffuse into the intercellular space. Presence of these lipids between the cells of the stratum corneum of the epidermis creates a barrier which is impermeable to water.</li>
                <li>The lamellar granules also contain proteolytic enzymes which are released in the most superficial layers of the epidermis. These enzymes cause a regulated breakdown of the desmosomes of the keratinocytes, so that these cells can exfoliate from the skin surface.</li>
                <li>As the keratinocytes move to the outer layer of the stratum granulosum, keratinization becomes progressively more pronounced and number of tonofibrils in the cytoplasm rapidly increases. With increase in the number of tonofibrils, the nuclei of the cells of stratum granulosum show degenerative changes and gradually become pale and indistinct. The cell organelles are lost as a result of autophagy by lysosomal enzymes. Consequently, the cells become dead before moving into the more superficial layers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Stratum Lucidum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The stratum lucidum is identifiable <strong>only in the thick skin covering the palms and soles</strong> (Fig. 15.4) and is not seen in the thin skin (Fig. 15.3). Many histologists do not recognize the stratum lucidum to be an independent layer but regard it as a subdivision of the stratum corneum of the thick skin.</li>
                <li>In the ordinary histological sections examined under low power of LM, the stratum lucidum appears as a thin, translucent, and refractile layer that stains poorly.</li>
                <li>Examination under the high power of the light microscope reveals that this layer is composed of three to five layers of closely packed and extremely flattened eosinophilic keratinocytes, which are still bound to each other by desmosomes.</li>
                <li>The nuclei and organelles of these cells have been lost and their cytoplasm consists chiefly of densely packed keratin filaments embedded in a protein called <strong>eleidin</strong>, which is a transformation product of keratohyalin.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Stratum Corneum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The stratum corneum, i.e., cornified layer, consists of many layers of flattened, highly keratinized keratinocytes called <strong>corneocytes</strong>. These cells are devoid of nuclei and organelles.</li>
                <li>The cytoplasmic space of the corneocytes is almost completely occupied by the bundles of tonofibrils embedded in a dense amorphous matrix. The keratinized cells become more and more flattened as the surface is approached.</li>
                <li>Simultaneously, their plasmalemma becomes very thick. Presence of flat, highly keratinized corneocytes (with a thick plasmalemma) on the surface of the epidermis provides the skin a great capacity of resistance against friction and abrasion.</li>
                <li>The phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and ceramides released by the lamellar granules of the keratinocyte of the stratum granulosum diffuse into the intercellular spaces of the cells of the stratum corneum. Presence of these pro-barrier lipids in the stratum corneum makes the epidermis impermeable to water and water-soluble substances.</li>
                <li>In the deeper layers of the stratum corneum, the corneocytes retain their desmosomes. In the most superficial layer, the cells become extremely thin and flat and are now called <em>squames</em>.</li>
                <li>The desmosomes of these cells are degraded and broken down by the special proteolytic enzymes released from the lamellar granules of the keratinocytes. Consequently, the dead corneocytes and are constantly exfoliated from the skin surface; this process is called <em>desquamation</em>.</li>
                <li>The thickness of the stratum corneum varies considerably in the skin over different parts of the body. It is the thickness of this layer that determines the overall thickness of the epidermis and differentiates the thick skin from thin skin. The stratum corneum is broadest in the thick skin covering the palms and soles (Fig. 18.3).</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="clinical">
                <h3>Clinical Application</h3>
                <p>The stratum corneum becomes abnormally thickened in those regions of the non-hairy, glabrous skin that are subjected to excessive friction; such abnormally thickened patches of skin are called <strong>callosities</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Psoriasis:</strong> In this condition, the turnover rate of keratinocytes is accelerated (cells reach the surface in 7 days instead of the normal 30-40 days). Keratinocytes do not have time to mature; the stratum granulosum is absent, and nucleated cells appear at the surface forming scaly plaques.</p>

        <!-- SECTION: DERMIS -->
        <section id="dermis">
            <h2>The Dermis (Corium)</h2>
            <p>The dermis, also called <strong>corium</strong>, is a sheet of connective tissue that supports the epidermis and gives the skin its flexibility and strength. Thickness of the dermis varies in different parts of the body; it ranges from 0.5 mm in the eyelids to almost 3 mm in the palms and soles. The dermis also lodges hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands, which are epidermal derivatives but project into the connective tissue of the dermis.</p>
            <p>The dermis is composed of two layers with rather indistinct boundaries. The outer layer, which lies just beneath the epidermis, is called <strong>papillary layer</strong>, while the deeper layer is known as <strong>reticular layer</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Papillary Layer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This layer is so named because it bears projections, called <strong>dermal papillae</strong> that protrude into the overlying epidermis. The dermal papillae interdigitate with reciprocal projections of epidermal epithelium that are called <em>epidermal ridges</em>.</li>
                <li>The papillary layer of the dermis is thinner than the reticular layer and consists of loose connective tissue composed of a network of fine collagen type I fibers, reticular fibers, and elastic fibers. Fibroblasts, macrophages and mast cells are also present in the connective tissue of the papillary layer.</li>
                <li>Special fibrils, called <em>anchoring fibrils</em>, which are composed of collagen type VII, extend from the basal lamina of the epidermal epithelium into the papillary layer. The anchoring fibrils serve to bind the epidermis to the dermis.</li>
                <li>The papillary layer is richly vascular and contains numerous capillary loops. The capillaries of the papillary layer regulate the body temperature and provide nourishment for the overlying epidermis (which is avascular). This layer also contains sensory nerves and sensory receptors. The receptors are mostly tactile corpuscles of <strong>Meissner</strong> that are located in the dermal papillae. These receptors are more commonly found in those areas of skin that are particularly sensitive to tactile stimulation, e.g., finger tips and lips. Some papillae also contain Krause end bulbs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reticular Layer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This layer is thicker and consists of dense, irregularly arranged connective tissue. It is composed mainly of interlacing bundles of collagen fibers. Many thick elastic fibers are also present. The intervals between the interlacing bundles of connective tissue fibers are filled with the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate.</li>
                <li>The reticular layer of the dermis is less cellular than the papillary layer; the cells found in this layer include fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and adipocytes.</li>
                <li>The reticular layer of the dermis generally contains two types of encapsulated sensory receptors which are <strong>Pacinian corpuscles</strong> and <strong>Ruffini corpuscles</strong>.</li>
                <li>Scattered smooth muscle fibers are found in the deeper part of the reticular layer of the dermis in the skin covering the areolae of nipples, penis, and scrotum. Such portions of the skin become wrinkled when these muscle fibers undergo contraction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Hair</h4>
            <p>Hairs are thread-like, keratinized structures that project from the epidermis. Thickness of the hairs varies considerably; in some regions of the body they may be as thin as 18 µm in diameter, while in other regions they may be as thick as 180 µm. The hairs are found over the entire skin except on the palms, soles, lips, dorsal surfaces of the distal phalanges, glans penis, glans clitoridis, labia minora, and vestibular aspect of the labia majora. Developmentally, each hair is derived from an invagination of the ectodermal epithelium of the epidermis into the underlying mesenchyme.</p>

        <!-- SECTION: HYPODERMIS -->
        <section id="hypodermis">
            <h2>Hypodermis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> In women, the amount of fat in the hypodermis is greater and is also more evenly distributed than in men.</li>
                <li>The hypodermis is more distinct in the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall, perineum and the limbs. However, it is very thin over the dorsal aspect of the hands and feet, face, and sides of the neck.</li>
                <li>The hypodermis contains collagen and elastic fibers that anchor the dermis of the skin to the deep fascia. The fat of the subcutaneous tissue is composed of unilocular adipocytes that are grouped together to form lobules, which are separated from each other by connective tissue septa.</li>
                <li>The number of adipocytes varies in different regions of the body and their size depends on the nutritional status of the individual. The fat in the hypodermis acts as a padding and serves as an energy store. This fat also serves to conserve the body heat and thus helps in thermoregulation.</li>
                <li>The hypodermis also lodges the mammary glands, deeper parts of the sweat glands, and lowermost portions of the hair follicles. It also contains blood vessels, lymph vessels, cutaneous nerves, Ruffini corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles. The subcutaneous tissue also contains skeletal muscle in the face, neck, and scrotum.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION: HAIR -->
        <section id="hair">
            <h2>Appendages: Hair</h2>
            <p>Each hair consists of two portions: a <em>shaft</em> and a <em>root</em>. The shaft projects above the skin surface, while the hair root is embedded in the skin.</p>
            
            <h3>Hair Follicle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Surrounding the hair root is a tubular <strong>hair follicle</strong> (Fig. 15.5) which consists of epidermal (epithelial) and dermal (connective tissue) elements.</li>
                <li>At its deep end, the hair follicle is expanded into a <em>hair bulb</em>. Here the hair root and its epithelial sheath blend in a mass of cells called <em>matrix</em>.</li>
                <li>Proliferation of the matrix cells is responsible for the growth of the hair and, therefore, these cells can be regarded to be homologous to the stratum basale of the epidermis.</li>
                <li>Melanocytes are scattered among the matrix cells, especially in the region immediately around the hair papilla. The melanocytes have long dendritic processes which transfer melanin granules to the cells of the hair cortex.</li>
                <li>There is an indentation at the basal end of the hair bulb which is occupied by a tuft of vascularized loose connective tissue called <strong>hair papilla</strong>. Associated with each hair follicle are one or more sebaceous glands and a bundle of smooth muscle fibers which constitutes the erector muscle of the hair and is called <strong>arrector pili</strong> (plural: arrectores pilorum).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Structure of the Hair</h3>
            <p>The hair shaft and root consist of epithelial cells arranged in three concentric regions: medulla, cortex and cuticle (Fig. 15.5).</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The medulla</strong> forms the central axis of the hair and consists of two or more layers of shrunken, moderately keratinized, cuboidal cells. The medulla is absent in very thin hair.</li>
                <li><strong>The cortex</strong> forms the main bulk of the hair. It is composed of long, flattened, fusiform, heavily keratinized cells which are very closely packed. In dark hair, the cells of the cortex contain granules of melanin pigment.</li>
                <li><strong>The cuticle</strong> is the outermost covering of the hair and consists of a single layer of heavily keratinized, squamous cells which partially overlap each other. The cells are non-nucleated except for those present in the lower part of the root.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The color of the hair depends on the type and quantity of melanin produced by the melanocytes located between the epithelial cells of the hair root. From the melanocytes, the pigment is transferred to the cortex of hair. The melanocytes of the hair root produce eumelanin or pheomelanin. The eumelanin makes the hair appear brown or black, whereas the pheomelanin colors the hair blond or red.</p>
            <p>Whitening of the hair, which normally begins around 40 years of age, occurs due to a gradual decrease in melanin formation by the melanocytes and ultimately death and disappearance of these cells from the hair root.</p>

            <h3>Layers of Hair Follicle</h3>
            <p>The hair follicle surrounds the root of the hair and is responsible for the production and growth of the hair. The hair follicles lie in the dermis but frequently invade the hypodermis. Each hair follicle consists of three parts: infundibulum, isthmus, and inferior segment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>infundibulum</strong> is the segment from the surface opening of the follicle to the level of opening of the duct of the sebaceous gland associated with the hair follicle. The infundibulum forms a part of the <em>pilosebaceous canal</em>, which serves as a route for the discharge of the sebum (secretion of the sebaceous glands).</li>
                <li>The <strong>isthmus</strong> is the part that lies between the opening of the sebaceous gland and attachment of arrector pili muscle.</li>
                <li>The <strong>inferior segment</strong> is the part from the arrector pili attachment to the proximal end (base) of the follicle where it expands to form the <em>hair bulb</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Two Major Coats of Hair Follicle (Fig 15.6)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Epithelial root sheath</strong>, which is derived from the epidermis. This sheath surrounds the hair root and lies immediately next to the hair cuticle.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Inner Epithelial Root Sheath:</strong> This sheath represents the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum of the epidermis. It does not extend above the point of entry of the duct of the sebaceous gland into the follicle.</li>
                        <li><strong>The External Epithelial Root Sheath:</strong> This sheath corresponds to the stratum spinosum and stratum basale layer of the epidermis. It lies surrounds the internal epithelial root sheath and covers it up to the epidermis of skin where the epithelial layers of this sheath become continuous with the stratum basale and stratum spinosum of the epidermis. Merkel cells are located among the cells of the outer epithelial root sheath especially in the large hair follicles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Connective tissue root sheath</strong>, which is derived from the dermis, surrounds the epithelial root sheath.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The external epithelial root sheath is separated from the connective tissue root sheath by an acellular hyaline layer called <strong>glassy membrane</strong>. This membrane is actually the thickened basement membrane of the epithelium of the epithelial root sheath.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Connective Tissue Root Sheath:</strong> This sheath lies outer to the epithelial root sheath. It consists of dense irregular connective tissue belonging to the dermis of skin and extends up to the level where the arrector pili muscle is attached to the hair follicle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Hair Growth Cycle</h3>
            <p>Between starting to grow and falling out years later, each hair passes through three phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. At any time, every hair is at a different stage of the growth cycle. The length of the hair growth cycle is variable on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, this cycle is completed in about 4 months. For the scalp hair, the length of the growth cycle is around 7 years. The following description of various phases of the hair growth cycle is regarding the scalp hair.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>anagen</strong> or <em>growing phase</em> is a long phase which lasts for 2-7 years and determines the length of the hair. The rate of the growth of the scalp hair is about 1.25 cm (1/2 inch) per month. This implies that a newly growing scalp hair would attain a length of approximately 15 cm (6 inches) in one year.</li>
                <li>The <strong>catagen</strong> or <em>regression phase</em> lasts for about 10 days. During this phase, the hair follicle shrinks and detaches from the dermal papilla.</li>
                <li>The <strong>telogen</strong> or <em>resting phase</em> lasts for 1-4 months. During this phase, the hair follicle remains dormant for many weeks and, at some point, begins to grow again. As the new growth cycle begins, the old hair breaks free from the follicle and is shed. Within 2 weeks of the shedding of the old hair, the new hair shaft makes its appearance on the surface of the skin.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Arrectores Pilorum</h3>
            <p>These are oblique bundles of smooth muscle fibers found in the dermis in relation to the hair follicles. An arrector pili muscle is attached at one end to the papillary layer of the dermis and at the other end to the connective tissue root sheath of a hair follicle at about middle of the follicle. Arrectores pilorum are innervated by the <strong>sympathetic nerve fibers</strong>.</p>
            <p>As indicated by their name, action of arrectores pilorum is to cause erection of the hair. Normally a hair is not erect (i.e., not set perpendicularly to the skin surface) but rather slopes at an obtuse angle. When arrectores pilorum contract, they cause erection of the hairs and elevation of the skin around the hair shafts, producing tiny bumps on the skin and thus giving the skin the appearance of “goose flesh”. When the skin surface is exposed to excessive cold, the arrectores pilorum undergo contraction producing erection of the hair in an attempt to create a pocket of warm air over the skin. The arrectores pilorum also contract when there is excessive sympathetic activity in the body, e.g., when a person is suddenly frightened.</p>
            <p><strong>Function of the Hairs:</strong> As opposed to the hairs of the animals, human hairs do not perform the insulating function against the heat loss. However, the human hairs play an important role in tactile sensation. Any stimulus that results in the deformation of a hair is transmitted along the shaft of the hair to the free nerve endings that surround the hair follicle.</p>

        <!-- SECTION: NAILS -->
        <section id="nails">
            <h2>Appendages: Nails</h2>
            <p>The nails consist of hard, translucent, roughly rectangular, horny plates, called <em>nail plates</em>, which cover the dorsal surfaces of the terminal phalanges of the fingers and toes. Microscopically, the nails are homologous with the stratum corneum of the epidermis and, therefore, the nail plate consists of extremely compact, highly keratinized epithelial cells. Each nail plate rests on a <em>nail bed</em> that consists of skin under the nail.</p>
            
            <h3>Parts of the Nail</h3>
            <p>Each <strong>nail plate</strong> consists of three parts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Body:</strong> This is the uncovered and visible part that rests on the nail bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Free edge:</strong> This is that part of the nail which projects beyond the skin distally.</li>
                <li><strong>Root:</strong> This is the proximal part of the nail that lies beneath a fold of the epidermis.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>The body of the nail is translucent and appears pink because it transmits the color of blood present in the underlying vascular tissue. The crescent-shaped whitish area on the proximal part of the nail body is known as <em>lunula</em>. It is a reflection of the partially keratinized cells in this region of the nail.</li>
                <li>The fold of the epidermis present around the proximal and lateral borders of the nail is known as <em>nail fold</em>. The furrow between the nail fold and nail bed is called <em>nail groove</em>.</li>
                <li>The epidermis of the <strong>nail bed</strong> consists only of the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. The dermis of the nail bed does not bear typical papillae but, instead, shows longitudinal ridges. The epidermis of the nail bed is very thick proximally and here it is known as <em>nail matrix</em>.</li>
                <li>The <strong>nail matrix</strong> is the germinative zone that exhibits a high rate of cell division and is responsible for the growth of the nails. The epithelial cells of the matrix proliferate constantly, move distally and eventually become keratinized. These keratinized cells are continuously added to the proximal part of the nail plate. As a result, the nail plate constantly slides forwards on the nail bed. The growth rate of the fingernails is about 0.5 mm per week, whereas the toenails grow at a much slower rate.</li>
                <li>The nail keratin is a hard keratin that consists of compactly packed keratin filaments lying in a matrix of amorphous keratin. This keratin has a high sulfur content, which imparts hardness to the nail plate. Unlike the keratinized cells of the ordinary epidermis, the keratinized cells of the nail plate do not desquamate.</li>
                <li>Epidermis of the nail bed is continuous distally with epidermis of the fingertip under the free edge of the nail. At this junction, the stratum corneum of the epidermis is thickened and is known as <em>hyponychium</em>. The stratum corneum of the proximal nail fold extends for a short distance over the free surface of the nail plate as <em>eponychium</em>.</li>

        <section id="sebaceous">
            <h2>Glands of the Skin: Sebaceous Glands</h2>
            <p>The skin contains two types of glands: sebaceous glands and sweat glands.</p>
            <p>The sebaceous glands are spherical or ovoid structures enclosed in a thin connective tissue capsule. They lie in the dermis and their ducts open into the infundibular parts of the hair follicles. A hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland are collectively known as a <em>pilosebaceous unit</em>. The duct of a sebaceous gland and the infundibulum of the hair together form the <em>pilosebaceous canal</em>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In certain locations, such as the glans penis, lips, labia minora and tarsal plates, the sebaceous glands are not associated with hair follicles and open directly upon the free surface of the skin.</li>
                <li>Sebaceous glands are very abundant in the skin of the face and scalp, but completely absent in the skin of the palms and soles.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Structure & Secretion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The sebaceous glands are simple branched acinar glands of the <strong>holocrine</strong> variety. Usually, several (5 to 20) acini open into the short wide duct. The acini are filled completely with a stratified epithelium.</li>
                <li>The most peripheral (basal) cells of an acinus are low cuboidal in shape and rest on a delicate basal lamina. The basal cells contain a spherical nucleus and their cytoplasm shows mitochondria, SER, glycogen granules and lipid droplets. These cells undergo mitosis to produce more basal cells and larger round cells. The round cells have more abundant SER and their cytoplasm contains more lipid droplets.</li>
                <li>When a sebaceous gland has released its secretion, the newly produced round cells gradually move toward the center of the acinus, where they attain a polyhedral shape and become still larger in size. Their cytoplasm gradually accumulates more and more fat (mostly cholesterol and triglycerides). Nuclei of these cells become pyknotic and then disappear. Finally, all of the centrally located cells break down into a fatty mass and cellular debris. This oily material, called <em>sebum</em>, is passed through the duct of the gland into the infundibulum of the hair follicle and thence onto the skin surface.</li>
                <li>Secretion of the sebaceous glands is under the control of androgens both in the male and female. In males, the controlling hormone is testosterone, whereas in the females it is a combination of the ovarian and adrenal androgens.</li>
                <li><strong>Function of the sebum:</strong> The oily sebum ensures the maintenance of proper skin texture and hair flexibility. It also has weak antifungal and antibacterial properties and thus contributes to the first line of defense against the harmful microorganisms.</li>

        <!-- SECTION: SWEAT GLANDS -->
        <section id="sweat">
            <h2>Sweat Glands</h2>
            <p>The sweat glands, also called <em>sudorific glands</em>, are generally classified into two types: (i) eccrine sweat glands, and (ii) apocrine sweat glands. The apocrine sweat glands are limited to certain specific regions of the body, whereas the eccrine sweat glands are distributed almost over the entire body surface. Because of the overwhelmingly greater number of the eccrine sweat glands, the term ‘sweat gland’ implies the eccrine sweat gland, unless otherwise specified.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Eccrine Sweat Glands</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The eccrine sweat glands are simple tubular glands having a diameter of 0.4 mm. These glands are distributed throughout the skin except that covering the glans penis. They are especially abundant in the skin of the palms and soles.</li>
                <li>The terminal secretory portion of a sweat gland is coiled and lies deeply in the dermis, commonly extending into the hypodermis. The duct of the gland travels through the dermis, joins the epidermis and spirals through it to reach the free surface, where it terminates at a small opening called <em>sweat pore</em>.</li>
                <li>The secretory portion of a sweat gland is lined by a simple cuboidal or low columnar epithelium surrounded by a basement membrane. Two varieties of cells can be distinguished in this epithelium: (1) clear cells, and (2) dark cells.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>clear cells</strong> stain very lightly because they do not contain secretory granules. These are pyramidal cells, each having a broad basal region that lies on the basal lamina, and a narrow apex, which does not reach the lumen. The apical parts of the clear cells communicate with the lumen through narrow intercellular canaliculi present between the dark cells. EM reveals that the clear cell cytoplasm contains organelles similar to those of the dark cells except that the RER and free ribosomes are scarce in these cells. These cells also show infoldings of the basal plasmalemma (which is a characteristic feature of those cells which are engaged in transepithelial fluid and electrolyte transport). The clear cells produce a serous (watery) secretion. This secretion reaches the lumen of the sweat gland through the intercellular canaliculi.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>dark cells</strong> are so named because they stain darkly in routine histological sections prepared for light microscopy. These cells have a narrow basal area and a broader apical part lining the lumen. Their basal end rarely touches the basal lamina. EM shows that these cells contain a prominent Golgi apparatus, long mitochondria, many cisternae of RER and abundant free ribosomes. Their broad apical portion contains dense secretory granules containing glycoproteins. The function of the dark cells is not very clear. It has been proposed that the secretion produced by these cells has bactericidal properties and thus plays a role in the innate immunity of the body.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In each sweat gland, a layer of <em>myoepithelial cells</em> is present between the bases of the lining secretory cells and their surrounding basement membrane. These cells are fusiform in shape and show cytoplasmic processes. Their cytoplasm contains actin and myosin filaments. The myoepithelial cells are supplied by sympathetic nerve fibers and their contraction results in the discharge of secretion from the secretory cells into the lumen of the sweat gland.</li>
                <li>The <strong>duct</strong> of a sweat gland is highly tortuous and is of smaller diameter than the secretory portion. It is lined by stratified cuboidal epithelium consisting of two layers of cuboidal cells. As the duct joins the epidermis, it loses its own wall and becomes a specialized passage through the stratified squamous epithelium.</li>
                <li>The sweat glands are innervated by <strong>cholinergic sympathetic</strong> nerve fibers. Their secretion is produced in response to heat and nervous strain.</li>
                <li><strong>The Sweat:</strong> The sweat is a clear, odorless fluid with an acidic pH (ranging from 4 to 6.8). The chief content of the sweat is water (98–99%). Apart from water, the sweat contains sodium, chloride, potassium, urea, ammonia, uric acid, and lactic acid, etc.</li>
                <li>The sweat performs three main <strong>functions</strong> for the body:
                    <ol>
                        <li>It plays an important role in temperature regulation by producing a film of moisture for evaporative cooling.</li>
                        <li>It is a source of excretion of waste products like ammonia, urea, and uric acid.</li>
                        <li>Due to its acidic pH and antimicrobial contents, the sweat protects the skin against colonization by bacteria and fungi.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Apocrine Sweat Glands</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The apocrine sweat glands are found <strong>only</strong> in certain specific locations in the body which include axilla, areola of the breast, circumanal region, and labia majora. These glands are also simple coiled tubular glands. The secretory portion is located deep in the dermis or in the upper region of the hypodermis.</li>
                <li>The duct of an apocrine sweat gland does not open onto the skin surface directly, but instead, it opens into the canal of a hair follicle just distal to the entry of the duct of the sebaceous gland.</li>
                <li>The lumen of the secretory portion of an apocrine sweat gland is larger than that of an eccrine sweat gland and is lined by a simple epithelium consisting of a single layer of cuboidal or low columnar cells.</li>
                <li>The lining cells contain a round or oval nucleus, abundant mitochondria, a large Golgi apparatus, numerous lysosomes, and many lipofuscin pigment granules. Myoepithelial cells are present between the secretory cells and their basal lamina.</li>
                <li>The apocrine sweat glands become functional at <strong>puberty</strong>. They produce a slightly viscous fluid, which contains proteins, carbohydrates, ammonia, lipids, and certain other organic compounds that may color the secretion. This secretion is odorless when it is released onto the skin surface, but quickly acquires a distinctive musky odor as a result of decomposition by bacteria present on the skin surface. The apocrine sweat glands are innervated by <strong>adrenergic sympathetic</strong> nerve fibers and they secrete in response to emotional and sensory stimuli.</li>
                <li>Previously it was held that these glands produce their product by an apocrine method of secretion and their product contains a portion of the apical parts of the secretory cells. However, EM studies have revealed that this concept is wrong. It has been found out that these special sweat glands also release their secretion by a <strong>merocrine</strong> method. It has been proved that the contents of the apical granules of the lining cells are released into the lumen of the gland by exocytosis and no part of the cell cytoplasm is lost into the secretion. However, conventionally but erroneously, these special large sweat glands are still titled as apocrine sweat glands.</li>

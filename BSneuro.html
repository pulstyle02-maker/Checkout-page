                options: ["Unconditioned Stimulus (US)", "Unconditioned Response (UR)", "Conditioned Stimulus (CS)", "Conditioned Response (CR)"], answer: 2,
                explanation: "The white coat was initially neutral, but became associated with the pain (US) and now elicits the fear (CR), making it the Conditioned Stimulus (CS)."

                options: ["Generalization", "Spontaneous Recovery", "Discrimination", "Extinction"], answer: 3,
                explanation: "Extinction occurs when the conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus, leading to the weakening of the conditioned response."

                options: ["Operant Punishment", "Negative Reinforcement", "Classical Extinction/Counter-conditioning", "Cognitive Restructuring"], answer: 2,
                explanation: "Systematic desensitization uses counter-conditioning to replace the fear response with relaxation, relying on classical extinction."

                explanation: "Internal Locus of Control, a concept often taught alongside learning principles, is the belief that one controls one's own fate, which increases compliance."
